**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">----Atomic Structure | Unit #2----</span>**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Atomic Structure & Subatomic Particles:</span>


---

**Atoms:**



* Elements are made of particles called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">atoms</span>
* Atoms are the smallest pieces of matter that contain all the properties of a specific element
* Each element contains only one type of atom.
1. Identified by name, symbol & atomic number
* Elements are listed on the periodic table by their unique chemical symbols
* Symbols are usually either one capital letter like C for carbon, or one capital and one lowercase letter like Ne for neon

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">AMU:</span>

Atomic Mass Unit



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>



**Subatomic Particles:**

**	Nucleus:**



* The nucleus is the positively charged dense core in the center of the atom
* Contains ~99.9% of the mass of the atom
* Houses protons and neutrons
1. This is also called the nucleons

	**Protons:**



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom</span>
* Have an electrical charge of (+)
* Mass of 1 AMU

**	Neutrons:**



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Neutral particles found in nucleus of atom</span>
* Have no electrical charge (neutral)
* Mass of 1 AMU

**	Electrons:**



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Negatively charged particles found in electron cloud</span>
* Have an electrical charge of -1
* Constantly moving around outside of nucleus of atom
* Have ESSENTIALLY no mass (1/1840 AMU)
* The number of protons is equal to the number of electrons only when the atom is neutral!

**Atomic Number:**

-The number of protons in an atom 

-is a whole number (shown on the periodic table)

-the periodic is arranged by the INCREASING atomic number

**Mass Number:**

-the total mass of protons and neutrons (thus giving us the equation: Mass = Protons + Neutrons)

-Always a whole number

-Not found on the periodic table

**Average Atomic Mass:**

-is acquired by **averaging **the natural abundances of its <span style="text-decoration:underline;">isotopes</span>

-represents a weight average

-when rounded, it gives the mass of the most common isotope

-formula

**AVG. ATM. MASS = (mass * (%/100)) + (mass * (%/100)) ...**

**Isotopes:**

-atoms of the same element (meaning has the same proton numbers) but with different numbers of neutrons

-Isotope Notation:

**12**

**    C**

**6**

Atomic #: 6 (Carbon), Mass #: 12, Protons: 6, Electrons: 6, Neutrons: 6

	**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Natural Abundances of Isotopes:</span>**



* Most elements are found as mixtures of isotopes
* Relative abundance of each isotope is the same in each source

**Allotropes:**

-chemical elements that exist in two or more different forms in the same phase with different physical and chemical properties are known as allotropes

-they are different structural modifications of an element



1. The atoms of the element are bonded together differently

-substances that have allotropes:



1. Carbon
2. Oxygen
3. Sulfur
4. Phosphorus

-generally, one allotrope will be far more abundant than another.



1. The O2 allotrope of oxygen is far more abundant than the O3 allotrope (ozone)

-carbon is the substance with the greatest number of allotropes



1. 8 have been discovered so far
2. Possesses allotropes most radically different from one  another 
1. Ranging from soft to hard
2. Opaque to transparent
3. Abrasive to smooth
4. Inexpensive to costly

![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


**Ions:**

-Atoms can gain or lose electrons to become charged particles called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ions</span>



1. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mon atomic</span> ions - one atom
2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Poly atomic</span> ions - two or more atoms

-The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">common oxidation states</span> listed on the periodic table indicate the numbers of electrons lost or gained by an element during bonding



1. Elements that bond to get **8 valence **(outermost)** electrons**, are referred to as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stable octets</span>; this is general rule
2. Electrons can be transferred or shared

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
-4
   </td>
   <td>Gained 4 electrons (taking in negativity)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>+2
   </td>
   <td>Lost 2 electrons
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>+4
   </td>
   <td>Lost 4 electrons
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Metal Ions:**

-metals tend to become <span style="text-decoration:underline;">positive ions</span>, called **cations,** by losing electrons



1. A sodium atom has 11 protons and 11 electrons, however a sodium <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ion</span> has 11 protons and 10 electrons. The charge on the ion is now +1 (meaning 1 more proton than electrons)

-in terms of size, positive ions are smaller than their original <span style="text-decoration:underline;">neutral</span> atom 



1. This is because positive ions have fewer electrons 

**Nonmetal Ions:**

-nonmetals tend to become negative ions called **anions** by gaining electrons



1. A chlorine atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons. However, a chlorine ion has 17 protons and 18 electrons. The charge on the ion is -1.

-in terms of size, negative ions are bigger than their original atom (they have more electrons) 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Practice Questions:</span>**



1. **Two particles have the respective composition:**

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td>
Protons
   </td>
   <td>Neutrons

**Exchange of Materials:**

-the exchange of materials happens at an animal cellâs cell membrane

-the reason being so:



1. Energy
2. Nutrients for important bodily functions
3. Oxygen
4. Waste: urea, CO2)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Unicellular</span>

-Happens via diffusion

-it is a very complex process, meaning diffusion would not work for hundreds of thousands of cells and onwards (See Limitations of Diffusion)

**Limitations of Diffusion:**

-diffusion uses too much energy and becomes too costly when it has to move materials across more than one cell barrier

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Circulation & the Circulatory System:</span>**

Things that need to be transported:



1. Nutrients & Fuels â  Digestive System
2. Respiratory Gases â O2, Co2 from & to gas exchange systems: lungs, gills, etc.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Roles in an Ecosystem:</span>**

Trophic Levels (refer back to the :

(5 levels):

Level 1: Producer [ Bottom of the triangle & Consists of: Plants, etc.]

Level 2: Primary Consumer [ Consists of: Herbivores ]

Level 3: Secondary Consumer [ Consists of: Carnivores &/or Omnivores ] 

Level 4: Tertiary Consumer [Consists of: Carnivores &/or Omnivores ]

[Not likely] Level 5: Quaternary Consumer [ Top of the triangle ]

**_Why only 5 levels in the trophic levels:_**

There is not enough energy being passed to the next trophic level

**Predation:**

-consists of predators:



1. Organisms that prey on other organisms naturally

-this a critical process in balancing a food chain

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Apex Predator:</span>

-top predator

-no natural predatory threat to them

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Keystone Species:</span>

-predator that balances a community

-very VERY critical, without them a food chain will collapse



1. They occupy a niche that holds the rest of its community in place

-critical to the structure of the ecosystem



1. Determines what organisms live there by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">keeping certain species from dominating an area</span>
1. Increases biodiversity

#### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Evolution</span>


---

**Theory-**a logical explanation based on all the available evidence, they must be capable of predicting further correlations

**Charles Darwin-**

-field biologist aboard the HMS Beagle

-the theorist for the modern accepted Evolution theory

-he did publicize much of his findings because of the heavy religious influence at that time

-came up with the mechanisms of evolution and so he did not come up with evolution

-his mechanisms of evolution were natural selection and descent with modification

**Jean Lamarck-**

-a French biologist (1744 to 1829)

-proposed that evolution took place based on specifically through the use of organs and appendages



1. This is not true

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Main Idea: </span>Use and Disuse and Acquiring traits 

**Diversification:**

-genetic variation / allele shuffling â result of sexual reproduction

-reproductive barrier: one population gets separated

-natural selection

**Speciation:**

**Adaptation:**

-a trait that allows an organism to be more successful in their environment

-a better chance for them to survive and reproduce and pass this trait on to their offspring

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Examples:</span>

Finches having different beaks in order to get certain seeds and food.

**Descent with modification:**

-when descendants further down the lineage that may have an allele frequency 

**Natural Selection:**

-organisms with more favorable traits for the environment can get to reproduce and survive and pass down those traits to their offspring(s)

**Clade / Node - **

-what the organisms further up in time have (bodily differences / abilities / adaptations)

**Phylogenetic Tree:**

-doesnât have to be from simple to complex

-are only hypothesis and can be redrawn when new evidence comes to light

-the organisms that are more in common, are much more common and share a more recent common ancestor

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Questions/Problems:</span>**



1. What did Darwin find in his study of various organisms?
2. Why might he be hesitant to release his findings?

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do Nows:</span>**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do Nows #1:</span>



1. Who was Charles Darwin and what is he known for?

_Charles Darwin was a field biologist who travelled to the Galapagos Islands in order to study the mechanisms of evolution._



2. What are some organisms Darwin studied in the Galapagos Islands?

_Tortoises, Finches, butterflies, blue footed boobies_



3. Explain what the term adaptation means (try using an example)

_Adaptation is the means by which certain features of an organism adapts to its current environment_



4. Explain Darwinâs terms of descent with modification and natural selection

_Descent with modification is the process by which organisms are modified from offspring to offspring in order to adapt to their environment. Natural selection is when organisms adapt to their environment. Descent Modification â Natural selection _



5. Explain why the following is incorrect due to a Lamarckian rationale: Bacteria mutated due to increased use of antibiotics, creating strains of bacteria that are now antibiotic resistant

_Sentence means: the bacteria acquired a new trait due to the antibiotic environment. This is not true evolution is not acquiring new traits, and instead is from adaptations_

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do Now #2:</span>



1. Can you explain vestigial structures in your own words?

Vestigial structures are structures that have lost use overtime.



2. What is a vestigial structure that we have that you were unaware of?

The little toe, goosebumps 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do Now #3:</span>



1. Does evolution occur at the level of the individual? Why/why not?

No and it occurs at the level of the population.



2. What is a gene pool in your own words?

Consist of all of the versions of the alleles for a gene in a given population



3. What is Genetic Drift?

The movement of genes in and out of a population



4. Can you explain and give examples of the Bottleneck Effect?

When a population size is reduced not because they were unfit but of other catastrophic events. 



5. What are the possible results of a Bottleneck Effect in a population

This can result in a less variation in one population 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do Now #4 / Edpuzzle Part 2 and 3:</span>



1. Explain the Founder Effect in your own words

When a small population is able to spread/grow into a larger population. The smaller population is caused by Gene Migration/Flow



2. How is Lake Maracaibo and Huntigtonâs Disease an example of this

They started with a small pocket of individuals that had the disease and quickly spread the disease to a larger population.



3. Explain the difference between the two types of Genetic Drift

Founderâs Effect: Isolation of gene pools

Bottleneck Effect: Species effected by catastrophic events, reduction in population



4. What is Gene Flow (or Gene Migration) in your own words?

The flow of genes from one population to another.



5. How is gene flow an important source of genetic variation for a population. Provide an example

It can help another population become more diverse. This can be things such as an adaptation that can be given to another population by another population via gene flow

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Edpuzzle Mechanisms for Evolution Part 3:</span>



1. Is natural selection random? Explain why or why not with an example

It is not random. Nature acts as the selecting agent that favors certain species/traits.



2. What does it mean to be âfitâ in terms of evolution?

By fit it means that an organism is able to pass on the gene and able to pass on the traits and contribute to the gene pool



3. Google images for Peppered Moths - explain how this is an example of natural selection

The environment after the smoke turned in favor for the dark moths



4. Explain and give examples of the 3 different types of phenotypic selection:

-Directional - Black and White moths

-Diversifying [Disruptive] - Extreme Phenotypes selected

-Stabilizing - Intermediate Phenotype selected



5. Explain what this means in your own words: The fitness of the organism is at the level of the genotype, but whatâs actually exposed to the environment is the phenotype.

The genotype determines the phenotype and the genotypes are the ones being passed down



6. Give an example of sexual selection that could be a good and a bad thing

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eukaryotes:</span>

-long lived

-regulated by transcription factors; regulatory proteins

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prokaryotes:</span>

-the regulator for prokaryotes is the environment

**Gene Expression:**

-environmental impact on gene regulation and expression (minimal)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Specialization-</span>

-when a cell has certain genes regulated to have its desired purpose



1. Stem cells
1. Two types: Embryonic and Somatic
2. Embryonic stem cells have much more diverse capabilities while somatic cells do not
3. Embryonic stem cells are found in embryos

Example: All human cells once started as a single zygote, as the zygote divided, some cells were regulated and became the 220+ human cell types (Mitosis)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stem Cells-</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Therapeutic cloning:</span>

**Cancer:**

**Questions:**



1. Is transcription of the structural genes activated or repressed under the conditions shown above? 

_It is activated because the inducer is attached to the repressor, which is detached from its operator gene, allowing transcription to occur._



2. If the regulator gene were to be deleted, how would this affect the expression of the structural genes? 

_There would be no repressor and the system would always be in an activated state--every gene would be expressed._



3. Describe what occurs during repression of the lac operon.

_A repressor protein binds to an operator gene, blocking RNA polymerase from beginning transcription._



4. Describe what occurs during the activation of the lac operon.

_A lactose molecule is used to deactivate the lac repressor gene, which allows the transcription of RNA to make enzymes to break down lactose._

**DNA Replication:**

-semi-conservative:



1. As the two strands of DNA unwind from each other, each acts as a template for synthesis of a new, complementary strand. This results in two DNA molecules with one original strand and one new strand.

-takes place in the S-Phase of interphase



1. So that each daughter cell can have the same amount of DNA and be genetically identical

-Enzymes:



1. Polymerase
2. Helicase-an enzyme that helps to separate the 2 strands of nucleotides on DNA
3. Ligase

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Semi-Conservative Model:</span>

-type of DNA replication in which the replicated double helix consists of one old strand, derived from the old molecule, and one newly made strand

-a new strand of DNA has a strand from the parent strand a daughter (new) strand

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Simplified Process:</span>



1. Parental Molecule of DNA

-The parental DNA first breaks down then unzips 

-breaks the hydrogen bonds connecting the nitrogenous bases



2. Both parental strands serve as templates

-daughter/new nucleotides will then find the appropriate pair (complementary)

-can be found from the food you eat

-hydrolyzed -> nucleus



3. Two identical daughter molecule of DNA

-one part is the daughter strand while the other part is the parent (original) strand

-conserves some of the parental DNA

1. Held in a DNA molecule

-Genes are made up of DNA

-Gene that codes for a particular protein to be built



1. Proteins are the most diverse

-the DNA has to go outside the nucleus



1. They go to a ribosome (rough ER, cytoplasm, nuclear envelope
2. But DNA cannot easily exit the Nucleus via the Nuclear Pore 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Transcription </span>

-DNAâs coded instruction is transcribed to mRNA [Nucleic Acid â Nucleic Acid]

-the DNA must go through this process in order to exit the Nucleus

-you are changing DNA to RNA



1. It is small enough to go through the Nuclear Pore
2. It will go through the nuclear pore and going to be read by a ribosome

-the language is Nucleic Acids

-the message from DNA is transcribed to the language of RNA

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Translation</span>

-takes place in the cytoplasm at the ribosome

-a language change

-the language changes from a Nucleic Acid to a protein (Amino Acids)

-the mRNA codons are translated into instructions for the appropriate amino acid

-nucleic acid â amino acid

-if a Stop amino acid appears, translation stops no matter where it is

**Remember: **one gene = one polypeptide

-genes contain your genotype

-polypeptide: chain of amino acids

-proteins can have up to 4 shapes (primary. Secondary, tertiary [protein], quaranary [more than one polypeptide chain])

-one gene codes for only one polypeptide

-that polypeptide chain is not a protein until they are in the tertiary structure

**Ribosome:**

-tRNA molecules fit in the A site first then P site

-

Small Subunit:

Large Subunit:

-has binding sites for tRNA

**RNA Polymerase:**

-copies DNA to mRNA form

**Processing & Modifying:**

-a cap and a tail is added on both sides of the mRNA



1. This cap and tail helps to make sure the mRNA will not get hydrolyzed by enzymes in the cytoplasm
2. Helps the ribosome recognize the mRNA

-processing is needed because some parts are not needed and need to be discarded

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Exons:</span>

-necessary parts and will not be removed

-has three stages that have the same names as Transcription



1. Initiation
2. Elongation
3. Termination

1. Synthesised in the nucleus and leaves to make the ribosomes

-reads RNA (mRNA)



1. Calls over 

**Mutations:**

-involve large regions of a chromosome or just a single nucleotide pair

-divided into 2 general categories: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Insertion/Deletion</span> & <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Substitution</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Substitution:</span>

-the replacement of one nucleotide and its base-pairing partner with another pair of nucleotides

Effects:

-the genetic code is redundant => some can have little to no effect (SILENT MUTATION) or they can be a MISSENSE MUTATION and still have little to no effect but can still lead to effects

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deletion/Insertion:</span>

-the addition or loss of a nucleotide pair

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Missense Mutation:</span>

A change in the nucleotide sequence of a gene alters the amino acid sequence of the resulting polypeptide. In a missense mutation, a codon is changed from encoding one amino acid to encoding a different amino acid

REMEMBER: Amino Acid => Protein Shape => Protein Function

-can have little to no effect

-can have great effects

SUMMARY: causes one amino acid to be substituted for another, which can have a range of effects 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Silent Mutations:</span>

A mutation in a gene that changes a codon to one that codes for the same amino acid as the original codon. The amino acid sequence of the resulting polypeptide is thus changed.

SUMMARY: a mutation that does exhibit an observable effect on an organismâs phenotype

-does not change the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nonsense Mutation:</span>

A change in the nucleotide sequence of a gene that converts an amino-acid-encoding codon to a stop codon. A nonsense mutation results in a shortened polypeptide.

SUMMARY: Results in the production of a premature âstopâ signal and will cause translation to be terminated early. Nonsense mutations frequently result in the product of a nonfunction protein

EFFECT: can produce a nonfunction protein

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Frameshift Mutations:</span>

A change in the genetic material that involves the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides in a gene, resulting in a change in the triplet grouping of nucleotides

-can be insertion or deletion

-may alter the reading frame (triplet grouping) of the genetic message 

-an insertion or deletion of nucleotides that is NOT A MULTIPLE OF THREE

-can lengthen or shorten the polypeptide

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Patterns of Inheritance</span>


---

**Heredity-**the transmission of traits from one generator to the next

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Genetics</span>-The scientific study of heredity. Modern genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the 19th century

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Character</span>-A heritable feature that varies among individuals (e.g. Flower Color)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Trait</span>-A variant for a character found within a population (e.g. purple flowers in pea plants)

**Genotype:**

-two characters

-example: Aa

-alleles

-the genetic makeup of an organism

-reflects all of the alleles/forms of the gene that are carried by the organism

**Phenotype:**

-the physical characteristics of an organism

-think **physical**

**Generations:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hybrids</span>-the offspring of two different varieties; an offspring of two parents that differ in one or more inherited traits; an individual that is heterozygous for one or more pairs of genes

**Gregor Mendel:**

-â Father of Geneticsâ

-his findings are referred to as Mendelian Genetics

-Principle of dominance, Segregation, and Independent Assortment discovery made in the 1850s-1860s

-he was a monk, but he got curious when the plants he grew had so much variation 

-he was lucky to study first with pea plants b/c there are only 2 types of plants

-the pea plant only had two 2 alleles

**Dominance:**

-three kinds of dominance

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Complete Dominance:</span>

-if there is a dominant allele in the genotype, the organism is going to show that

-recessive allele is hidden

-the only time where it will not show, is when there are 2 recessive alleles

-only one allele in the genotype is seen in the phenotype  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Co-Dominant/Codominant:</span>

-when the heterozygous phenotype is shown

-when the two alleles are dominant together

-traits of both alleles show up in the phenotype

-both alleles in the genotype are seen in the phenotype

-neither allele is dominant over the other

-both alleles are expressed

-refers to inheritance in which two alleles of a gene each have a different observable effect on the phenotype of a heterozygous individual

-neither allele is recessive; both alleles are dominant

**NO BLENDING**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Incomplete dominance:</span>

**BLENDING**

-neither allele is completely dominant over the other

For example:

A red and a blue flower in this kind of dominance will become a purple flower

-this is due to the two alleles being incompletely dominant

-mix

-a mixture of the alleles in the genotype is seen in the phenotype 

**Traits:** visible expressions of genes

-examples: the color of a plant, hair color, eye color

-physical manifestation

-traits are not always the product of a single gene!

**Genetic Crosses:**

-a mating of two sexually reproducing individuals often used to describe a genetics experiment involving a controlled mating

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">True Breeding:</span>

-referring to organisms for which sexual reproduction produces offspring with inherited traits identical to those of the parents

-True-breeding means that a homozygous dominant individual, when self-fertilized, would produce only homozygous dominant individuals. 

-The same would also be true of a homozygous recessive individual only producing homozygous recessive individuals.

-the organism is homozygous for the characters under consideration

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">P Generation:</span>

-the true-breeding parents

-P stands for Paternal

-the parent individuals from which offspring are derived in studies of the inheritance

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">F1 Generation:</span>

-hybrid offspring of the P Generation

-contain both forms of genes

-F stands for filial, in Latin meaning for âsonâ

-the offspring of two paternal (P Generation) individuals

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">F2 Generation:</span>

-the offspring when F1 plans self-fertilize or fertilize each other

-the F still stands for filial

-Mendelâs Quantitative analysis of the F2 Plants from thousands of genetic crosses allowed him to deduce the fundamental principles of heredity

-will exhibit both parental characteristics

-

**Monohybrid Cross:**

-follows one character 

-an experimental mating of individuals that are heterozygous for the character being followed (or the self-pollination of a heterozygous plant)

**Test Cross:**

-can be used to determine whether an organism with a dominant phenotype is homozygous or heterozygous

-the mating between an individual of unknown genotype for a particular character and an individual that is homozygous recessive for that same character

-can be used to determine the unknown genotype

-homozygous dominant versus heterozygous

-involves mating an unknown genotypic individual with a known homozygous recessive



1. Recessive alleles will **always **be masked by the presence of dominant alleles
2. The phenotype of any offspring will reflect the genotype of the unknown parent

-require large numbers of offspring to produce reliable data

-the way to explore the genotype of an organism

-example of a test cross using the letters A & a: A? X aa

**Mendelâs Findings:**

-traits come in different version [alleles]

-genes are inherited units (from parents)

-predictions can be made about inheritance traits

-predictions are often done in Punnett squares

![alt_text](images/image18.png "image_tooltip")


**Alleles:**

-alternative versions of a gene

-for each character, an organism inherits two alleles; one from each parent



1. Can be different or identical

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dominant Allele:</span>

-easier to get access

-easier to read 

-indicated with an uppercase letter (italics)

-the allele that determines the phenotype of a gene when the individual is heterozygous for that gene

-the allele that is **phenotypically **expressed over another allele

-does not mean this trait is most common!



1. The dominant only means that when present, it has a strong tendency to express over other alleles

Wild Type-allele producing functional proteins

-wild type means the organism occurs as is in nature

-does not mean it is better

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Recessive Allele:</span>

-harder to read

-less access

-indicated with a lowercase letter (italics)

-has no noticeable effect on the organismâs appearance WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS HETEROZYGOUS FOR THAT TRAIT

-allele that is only expressed in absence of a dominant allele

Mutant allele producing a functional protein

-mutant means the organism has been altered either phenotype or genotype or both

-is not in their 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">TERMS TO REMEMBER:</span>**

Ratio Example: 1:2

Frequency: Â¼

Probability: 25%

**Homozygous:**

-an organism that has two identical alleles for a gene

-referred to as a homozygote

-pure

-same

-means to have two identical alleles for a particular gene

-if you have two of the same allele

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Homozygous Dominant: </span>TT, II, LL, OO, PP

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Homozygous Recessive: </span>tt, ff, gg, hh

**Heterozygous:**

-an organism that has two different alleles for a gene

-referred to as a heterozygote

-hybrid

-other

-zygote

-means to have two different alleles for a particular gene

-**when two are heterozygous for two traits, the offspring ratio is always 9:3:3:1**

-if you have two different alleles

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example of Heterozygous:</span>

Tt, Oo, Aa, Pp, Qq

**Law of Segregation:**

A general rule in heritance that individuals have two alleles for each gene and that when gametes from by meiosis, the two alleles separate, each resulting gamete ending up with only one allele for each gene; also know as Mendelâs First law of Inheritance

-for a diploid organism, the inheritance of each gene will segregate during meiosis and into four gametes

-gametes getting only one copy of each allele of each gene.

-formulated as a result of performing monohybrid cross experiments on plants



1. He witnessed complete dominance
2. Complete dominance is when one phenotype is dominant while the other is recessive

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Four main concepts:</span>



1. A gene can exist in more than one form or allele
2. Organisms inherit two alleles from each trait
3. When sex cells (gametes) produced (by meiosis), allele pairs separate leaving each cell with a single allele for each trait
4. When the two alleles of a pair are different, one is dominant and the other is recessive

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example:</span>

A sperm or egg carries only one allele for each inherited character because allele pairs separate/segregate from each other during the production of gametes.

**Law of Independent Assortment:**

A general rule of inheritance that when gametes form during meiosis, each pair of alleles for a particular character segregates independently of other pairs; also knows as Mendelâs second law of inheritance

-the inheritance of one character does not affect the inheritance of another

-during meiosis, homologous chromosomes are going to find each other. All 23 pairs find each other during metaphase I of meiosis. When they line up and get separated, each chromosome does not have to do with how the other separates

**Chromosome Theory of Inheritance:**

-genes segregate

-chromosomes come in pairs

-is supported by the fact that genes do segregate and genes and chromosomes do come in pairs. Also, many genes assort independently of one another.

**Dependent Assortment:**

-a hypothesis

-predicts that the inheritance of physical characteristics are linked during gamete formation

**Punnett Square:**

-a diagram that can be used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes resulting from a genetic cross

-Single gene: Monohybrid

-a diagram used in the study of inheritance to show the results of **random fertilization **

-16 boxes

-examines 2 characters

-an experiment mating of individuals that are each heterozygous for both of two characters

-a mating of parental varieties differing in two characters 

-none of the produced gametes are the same

**when two are heterozygous for two traits, the offspring ratio is always 9:3:3:1**

**AaBb: 9:3:3:1**

**RrBbGg x RrBbGg: 1/64 for all homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rule of Multiplication:</span>

A rule stating that the probability of a compound event is the product of the separate probabilities of the independent events

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rule of Addition:</span>

A rule stating that the probability that an event can occur in two or more alternative ways is the sum of the separate probabilities of the different ways

**Multiple Alleles:**

-genes found in a population with more than 2 versions

**Blood Type & the blood-**

-red blood cells (RBC) can also be referred to as erythrocyte

-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">blood groups show codominance</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Plasma: </span>the liquid portion of the blood

-contains antibodies

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Humans have blood types of </span>A, B & O

-3 possible alleles

-determined by red blood cells (represented)

-A and B are both dominant over O; O is recessive

F -when writing 

-universal donor: O, can receive plasma from any blood group, but can only donate plasma to the O group

-universal recipient: AB, but can only receive blood plasma from AB type

-the best blood type for a donation of blood is **O- (O Negative)**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ABO Blood Types:</span>

AB:

-for plasma has neither A nor B antibodies

-has A and B antigens

-cannot accept blood from blood with Anti-B and Anti-A blood types because of the antibody clumping to the cell and forming a blood clot

O:

-has both anti-A and anti-B antibodies

-does not have any antigen

-cannot accept blood with Antigen A and Antigen B

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blood Transfusion:</span>

-if the wrong blood type is administered it can cause clumping or the bursting of blood vessels

-can be fatal

-for example, the transfusion of type A blood to a person with type B blood is fatal because of the 

Antibodies reacting with the antigens on the other blood type

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blood Centrifuge:</span>

-a centrifuge that spends the vile of blood based on density

-the four parts of the blood gets split

-separate the plasma and white blood cells with the RBC

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Positive Negative Blood (Rhesus Factor):</span>

-separate trait/allele

-does not have anything to do with I^A

-the Rhesus Factor

-if you have the Rhesus gene you are positive while not having it is negative

-blood transfusion also have to match the positive and negative sign

-this means that now O- is the universal donor 

-also known as the Rhesus gene

**Polygenic:**

-poly-three or more

-traits produced by the interaction of several genes

-example: skin color in humans 

-phenotype is governed by multiple genes

-a trait is a phenotype

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Polygenic Inheritance:</span>

-one gene that code for many phenotypic traits

-12 genes govern the skin pigmentation 



1. Control melanin production
2. Melanin is a protein that provides color/pigmentation for the skin color 
3. Melanin is found in the skin cells
4. The closer you are to the equator, the melanin production increases, and the skin color gets darker
5. Melanin loves to hang out at the nucleus, this is because sunlight can harm the genetic information in the nucleus.
6. Without melanin and there is a lot of sunlight, it can cause skin cancer
7. It is not entirely proof, it is only an evolutionary trait
8. Tan is a full-body skin scab
9. In conclusion the sun is not good for your skin

-the traits are governed by many genes

-controlled on different chromosomes

**Pleiotropy:**

-a single allele that control more than one character 

-the ability of a gene to affect an organism in many ways

-pleio = more

**Linked Genes:**

-Linked = genes for two different traits are located on the same chromosome pair

-are usually inherited together

-genes that tend to sit closer together

-they are inherited together also because they are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">on the same chromosome</span>



1. Genes located on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together and are said to be linked genes
2. They may or may not be functionally related

-more likely to move with one another if crossing over occurs

-far apart genes-more likely to cross over

-Geneticist construct maps based on linkage and frequency of crossing over

-Closer = less likely to be separate; linked

-not two genes next to each other

-**Crossover percentage between two different genes is greater as the distance between the two genes increases**

-genes that sit really close to each other and code for two different traits

-these genes inherited together during crossover (crossover with one another)

-linked genes on the 23rd chromosome is known as Sex linked genes

**Sex Linked Genes:**

-genes on the same chromosome that determines sex

-sits on the 23rd chromosome or the âSex Chromosomeâ (the one that determines sex/gender)

-some traits expression of an allele is dependent on the sex of the individual 

-the sex linked genes are carried on the X chromosome

-females and males all have X chromosomes



1. This is why most genes and disorders reside on the X chromosome because the genes are always passed down from the X chromosome 

-you have to include XY in your alleles

-if it is an X linked trait, the trait letter should mostly be on the X chromosome, the Y chromosome does not have the letter in the top right corner

**XY Chromosomes (& Gender):**

-Maleness is determined by the SRY gene



1. The SRY gene is found on the Y chromosome

-a phenotypic XY woman is possible because: 



1. The SRY locus of the Y chromosome is deleted
2. If the SRY is deleted, the Y chromosome would still be present, but development would occur along the female path

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">SRY Gene:</span>

-is known as the âSex-determining Region Yâ \
-protein

-if an XY individual is missing the SRY gene:

That individual is still a male as they have the X and the Y sex chromosome but since they are missing the gene that gives them their male traits, they would have facial characteristics (phenotype) of a woman

**Autosomal Linked Genes:**

-found on the 1-22 chromosomes

-does not have the X and/or Y alleles when writing

-located on the autosomes

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Autosomal Dominant:</span>

-never skip generation

-involved male-to-male transmission

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Autosomal Recessive:</span>

-can/usually skip generation

-also involves male-to-male transmission

-involve consanguinity (descended from the same ancestor)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dominant Disorders:</span>

-disorders that happen on the dominant allele

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Achondroplasia</span>:

-For example aa: would be normal; Aa -> Achondroplasia; AA -> Death

-When your brain does not stimulate/produce enough growth hormone

-also known as Dwarfism

-the growth hormone does not talk to enough to the limbs 

-homozygous dominant means that there would not be enough growth hormone for any part of the body leading to a miscarriage; do not leave

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Huntingtonâs Disease:</span>

-one copy of the Allele: Aa or AA

-Neurological genetic disorder

-a late-acting lethal dominant allele

-diagnosed 20-30 years old

-fatal genetic disorder

-uncommon but there is are still many

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hypercholesterolemia:</span>

-high levels of LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream

-an inherited condition that displays incomplete dominance

-cholesterol related (synthesised by the liver)

-is a **Autosomal Dominant Disease/Disorder**

-Hyper- High Quantity; Cholesterol; emia: in the blood

-can be fatal

-not enough of the cholesterol going into the cells

-genetic disorder not autosomal

-LDL stands for Low Density Lipoprotein



1. Tries to get to cells in your blood
2. Travels through your blood
3. Have to make their way into cells to help the synthesis bigger things
4. Acts as the key and the cell acts like the lock
5. So cholesterol is not building up in the blood

-incomplete dominance

-hh: homozygous ability to make LDL receptors

-Hh: Heterozygous

-HH: Homozygous for **inability** to make LDL receptors

**X Linked:**

-this gene appears on the X chromosome

-X linked disorders on a male will not make that male a carrier

-does not involved any type of male-to-male transmission

-if the father has X linked disorder, the daughter will 100% have the disorder be passed down



1. This due to the fact that the father passes down the diseased X chromosome to his daughter

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">X-Linked Recessive</span>

-skip a generation

-does not involve male-to-male transmission

-males are usually predominantly affected

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">X-Linked Dominant</span>

-usually does not skip a generation

-does not involve male-to-male transmission

**Y-Linked:**

-occurs on the Y Chromosome

-passed from male to male

-very distinct

**Genetic Diseases:**

-recessive diseases are more common and not lost from generation to generation



1. An individual can be a carrier and does not have to manifest in their manifest

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tay Sachs:</span>

-autosomal recessive

-build up of fat on the brain due to failure to product correct

-the genotype (using the letter A:a) => aa (lower case)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sickle Cell Anemia:</span>

-the genotype (using the letter S) => ss (lowercase)

-autosomal recessive

-sick shaped RBC

-blood tests can help determine if one have sickle cell or not

-more likely to occur in people of African descent

-Ss â heterozygote advantage

-one wrong (pleiotropy) letter can cause the following



1. Breakdown of red blood cells
2. Clumping of cells and clogging of small blood vessels
3. Accumulation of sickled cells in spleen

-one of this gene causes these many disorders

-evolution still allows this disorder to stay because



1. Malaria and sickle cell could be connected and can be an evolutionary development that is not quite suited for all. To protect that person against the malaria
2. Strong selection against the sick cell gene
3.  

-the allows for a small intake of oxygen that the blood cell can carry

-the HeteroZygote advantage is necessary for the location that has a lot of Malaria, while other locations with not a lot of Malaria would not be beneficial to have that allele

-the red blood cells can break down, clump, and/or clog blood vessels



1. Blood vessels and broken cells accumulate in the spleen
2. Leads to physical weakness
3. Heart failure
4. Pain
5. Brain damage
6. **All of this is explained by the PLEIOTROPIC effect of the sickle cell allele**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cystic Fibrosis:</span>

-the excess amount of mucus in the lungs, digestive tract, liver

-this leads to increased susceptibility to infections

-death can occur in early childhood if not treated

-there are over 100 alleles know for the gene associated with this disease

**Pleiotropy:**

-opposite of polygenic inheritance

-one trait (gene) causes multiple phenotypic variation

**Pedigree:**

-family tree

-a image that shows lineage and shows certain disorders/traits

-describes the traits of the parents and children across generations

-more specifically: A family genetic tree representing the occurrence of heritable traits in parents and offspring across a number of generations.

-A pedigree can be used to determine genotypes of matings that have already occurred

-in most cases, if an organism has a clear shape, they do not have or carry the allele

-if the shape is half colored, they are a carrier (one normal allele and one diseased trait)

-if the shape is entirely colored that organism has and manifest the alleles

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Legend (unless otherwise):</span>

Circle: Female

Square: Male

Half shaded: Carrier

-Look for Question 5 and 6

-if a mom is a carrier, she is not colorblind because the dominant allele will hide the recessive allele



1. Even though she does not manifest it, she can pass down the allele

**Genetic Testing:**

-prenatal genetic screening

-many of these testing can include such risks:



1. Vaginal cramping
2. Miscarriage
3. Premature birth
4. But all have declined due to technological advancement

-ultrasound: shows an image of the fetus (does not show fetal chromosomes)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ultrasound:</span>



1. The least evasive testing 

-one explain is amniocentesis



1. A needle is inserted into the amniotic sac
2. Guided by ultrasound (uses sounds to produce an image; based on density; used for medical diagnostics )
3. Extract amniotic fluid (the cells of the baby)
4. Produces an image of a karyotype
5. Older parents might want to test for down syndrome as well since the risk as you get older is higher

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chorionic Villus Sampling (Ultrasound imaging):</span>

-a physician uses ultrasound to guide a narrow flexible tube through a womanâs vagine and into her uterus

-allows the chromosomes of the fetus to be examined

-includes sampling fetal tissue

-the tip of the tube is placed next to the villi

-the cells from the villi are then gently removed and then tested for genetic disorders

-the same goal as the amniocentesis

-extracted from the Chorionic villi and not the amniotic fluid

-the benefit is the quick response time for the final karyotype

-has a chance for miscarriag

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Preimplantation genetic diagnosis</span>

-happens to test the embryo before the baby forms

-physically extract 6 eggs from the mother

-the dad would give 6 sperm sample

-they join the eggs and sperms (fertilizations)

-produces 6 zygotes

-they speed up mitosis in the zygotes

-the zygotes are then called embryos 

-they now will take each cell from each embryo and then perform genetic testing 

-the end result for the parents depend on the standing position of the couples (discard or keep)

-intercourse did not happen and developed/fertilized outside of the mother

-after the testing, the couple can decide to implant the âgoodâ/ânormalâ embryos back into the motherâs uterus

-not a cheap process

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">AFP (alpha-fetoprotein):</span>

-obtained from a maternal blood sample

**Hemophilia:**

-when the blood does not clot properly

-platelets are the ones that clot the blood/blocking blood

-lacks the ability to trigger clotting fiber

-can be fatal

-not playing contact sports

-sex linked disorder not autosomal linked 

-an X linked recessive 

**Platelets:**

-produces platelet factors that grab things nearby

-triggers clotting fibers that will stop you from bleeding all the time

**Genes & the Environment**

-nature & nurture



1. Nature here means: Our genetics determine our behavior(s). Our personality traits and abilities are in our ânatureâ
2. Nurture here means: Our environment upbringing, and life experiences determine our behavior. We are ânurturedâ to behave in certain ways
3. For example your blood type will not be altered by your environment 
4. For example, your skin color can alter this gene

-environmental conditions can affect gene expression and influence genetically determined traits

-some animals can have their coat/fur change color due to the temperature

-the environment can cause the phenotypic to change

-super common with organisms

-the evolutionary benefit is that the organism gets to have better camouflage

-for most traits itâs difficult to know the relative weight of genetic versus environment factors

-genes and environment collaborate in unknown and/or complicated ways in the development of traits

**Selective breeding:**

-have been going on for thousands of years and have been considered beneficial

-method of breeding that allows only those organisms with desired characteristics/traits to product the next generation

-every dog specie is part of the same specie

-artificial selection

-breeding individual organisms for a particular traits

**Include:**

Autosomal dominant

- Never skip generation

- Involve male-to-male transmission

Autosomal recessive

- Usually skip generation

- Involve male-to-male transmission

- Involve consanguinity

X-linked recessive

- Usually do not skip generation

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Questions:</span>**



1. Describe three generations of your own family using the terminology of a genetic cross (P, F1, F2).

The P generation is the âoriginal



2. How can two plants with different genotypes for a particular inherited character be identical in phenotype?
3. You can use a testcross to determine the genotype of a Lab with normal eyes. Half of the offspring are normal and half develop PRA. What is the genotype of the normal parent?
4. A plant of genotype AABbCC is crossed with an AaBbCc plant. What is the probability of an offspring having the genotype AABBCC?
5. X-Linked genes are never passed from father to son why?

Since males only have one X Chromosome, this means they will always pass down their X chromosome only to their daughter and their Y Chromosome to their son. The sonâs X Chromosome comes from their mother because their mother has 2 X Chromosomes.



6. Males are never just carries, why?

Men are XY and this means they cannot have the recessive (diseased) allele on the X because they only have 1 X. This means they either have it or donât.



7. If one parent is blood type AB and the other is type O, what fraction of their offspring are expected to have Blood type A?

50% (0.5); About half the offspring would be expected to inherit the

and be phenotypically A (having the A blood type)



8. In a family with a severely affected father and an unaffected mother, what percentage of their children are expected to have higher than normal blood cholesterol? (Hypercholesterolemia)

100%; Individuals with two copies of the hypercholesterolemia allele suffer from severe hypercholesterolemia. However, if you inherit only one copy of this allele, you would still inherit the predisposition to have higher than normal blood cholesterol levels.



9. There are over 100 alleles known for the gene associated with cystic fibrosis. With current technology, it is possible to determine exactly which allele or alleles is/are carried by a person. What is the maximum number of different alleles that any person can carry?

2; Because there are two homologous chromosomes, each with one locus for this and every other gene, a person may carry up to two different alleles for this gene



10. In breeding pure-breeding large and small strains of mice, you cross individuals of each strain and note that their offspring are intermediate in size. Two models (explanations) to account for this result are (1) that body size in these strains 

Intercross the

contains two size classes (consistent with the polygenic model)



11. Two parents of mixed ethnicity have twins, one of which is born white and one of which is born black. This is because of ___ 

The polygenic nature of skin color genes; Skin color is known to be affected by at least three genes, possibly more



12. Our understanding of the role played by genes in many human characteristics is advancing rapidly in, for example, body size, performance on IQ tests, and personality traits. In this new genetic era, the role of the environment ____.

Is to work with genes in complex and often unknown ways in the development of these traits; genes and environment collaborate in complicated and often unknown ways in the development of traits



13. In Morgan's testcross of a gray-bodied, long-winged heterozygous female Drosophila with a homozygous recessive black-bodied, vestigial-winged male, the following offspring were obtained: 965 gray body, long wing; 944 black body, vestigial wing; 206 gray body, vestigial wing; 185 black body, long wing. Focusing only on the recombinant classes (gray body, vestigial wing and black body, long wing), the numbers of offspring of each type are similar (206 and 185). What accounts for the similar number of offspring of each recombinant phenotype?

Crossing over between chromosomes is reciprocal, so whenever a recombinant chromosome of one type is produced, thereâs a recombinant of the opposite type that is also produced.



14. In a particular species of mammal, black hair (B) is dominant to green hair (b), and red eyes (R) are dominant to white eyes (r). When a BbRr individual is mated with a bbrr individual, offspring are produced in a ratio of 5 black hair and red eyes : 5 green hair and white eyes : 1 black hair and white eyes : 1 green hair and red eyes. Which of these explanations accounts for this ratio?

The genes for hair color and eye color are linked; This explains why the parental types occur more often than would be expected if the characters assorted at random.



15. The crossover percentage between two different genes is ___.

Greater as the distance between the two genes increases (refer back to Linked Genes above); If the chance of crossing over is equal along the length of the chromosome, the farther apart two genes are, the higher the probability that a crossover will occur between them, and therefore the higher the recombination frequency.



16. The existence of rare XY individuals who are phenotypically normal women was instrumental in learning about human sex determination. Maleness is determined by the SRY gene found on the Y chromosome. How is it possible to be an XY woman?

The SRY locus on the Y chromosome is deleted; If SRY is deleted, the Y chromosome would still be present, but development would occur along the female path



17. A woman and her male partner have normal color vision. However, her father and her first son are colorblind. What is her genotype? Use C as the gene for colorblindness.

A, B, O. I^A, I^B, I^O



4. What does it mean if someone has Blood Type A? (Use the terms antigen, RBCâs, and antibodies)

When someone has type A blood, it means that the Antigen on the surface of RBC are Type A along with this, their antibodies are Anti-B

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do Now #5:</span>**

My sister is Blood Type B. My brother-in-law is Blood Type O. Could my niece (their child) be Blood Type AB? Explain.

No because there is no Blood Type A present meaning that the A allele is not present along with O being homozygous Recessive.

1.Can you explain the difference between multiple alleles for one particular trait (as in Blood Typing) versus polygenic inheritance?

Multiple Alleles is when there are more 2 or more versions of that gene. On the other hand polygenic inheritance is multiple homologs with multiple genes that code for one trait.

 \
2.Why canât a male be a carrier for colorblindness?

Males only have one X chromosome meaning they cannot carry a dominant allele and recessive at the same time. Colorblindness is also a recessive trait.

**Part 2: Meiosis and Crossing Over:**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chromosomes are matched in homologous pairs:</span>**

**Homologous Chromosomes:**

-can also be called homologous

-these matching pairs 

-cells viewed during the metaphase period can be arranged into matching pairs

-when treated with special dyes, chromosomes of a pair display matching staining patterns

-almost every chromosome has a twin that resembles it



1. Length
2. Centromere positioning
3. Staining pattern

-the two chromosomes of a homologous pair may have different versions of the same gene

?

**Chiasma/ta:**

Chiasma->Singular

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chiasmata-</span>hold the homologous chromosomes together as a homologous pair until anaphase I

-formation between non-sister chromatids can result in the exchange of alleles

-X-shaped points of attachments between two non-sister chromatids of a homologous pair

-they form as a result of crossing over and hence non-sister chromatids should show an exchange of genetic material

-the exchange of genetic material is most easily show if homologous chromosomes are differentially color-coded

**X & Y Chromosomes:**

-are an important exception to the general pattern of homologous chromosomes in human somatic cells

-human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes; XX

-human males have one X and one Y chromosomes; XY

-only small parts of the XY chromosomes are homologous

-**GENES CARRIED ON THE X CHROMOSOME DO NOT APPEAR ON THE TINY Y**

**-Y CHROMOSOME HAS GENES NOT PRESENT ON THE X**

-the reason being that the XY chromosomes determines an individualâs sex; **sex chromosomes**

-chromosomes other than sex chromosomes are called **autosomes**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Gametes have a single set of chromosomes:</span>**

**Life Cycle:**

-the development of a fertilized egg into a new adult organism



1. One phase of an organismâs life cycle
2. The sequence of stages leading from the adults of one generation to the adults of the next

-two sets of chromosomes inherited from each parent is very important

**Fertilization-**the union of the nucleus of a sperm cell with the nucleus of an egg cell, producing a zygote

**Zygote-**the diploid fertilized egg, which results from the union of a sperm cell nucleus and an egg cell nucleus

**Meiosis: **(can also be called, reduction division)

-starts with a germ cell (diploid)

-provides variation

-there is two cell divisions: Meiosis 1 and Meiosis 2

-starts with 1 diploid cell

-the end is 4 **haploid **cells

-the goal is to reduce genetic material by half



1. If the genetic material did not half, there would be too much genetic material in the offspring

-goes through interphase



1. Replication of the DNA/genetic material
2. All DNA and genetic materials will currently be in the chromatin (decondensed) form
3. After this phase, the cell can be ready for **both mitosis and meiosis**

**Basic Representation of the entire Meiosis phase:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">1.Interphase:</span>



1. A pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid parent cell, the chromosomes then duplicates
2. A pair of duplicated homologous chromosomes

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2.Meiosis I:</span>



1. Homologous chromosomes from interphase separates
1. Segregates the two chromosomes of the homologous pair
2. Packaging of these two chromosomes into separate haploid daughter cells
3. Each chromosome is still doubled

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">3.Meiosis II:</span>



1. Sister chromatids then separate resulting in the production of 4 haploid daughter cells
1. Each of the four daughter cells is haploid and contains only a single chromosome from the homologous pair

**Differences:**

Prophase 1 v. Prophase 2

-Prophase 1 starts with an interphase, but prophase 2 does not

-The **PAIRING OF HOMOLOGOUS **chromosomes occur in Prophase 1, but not in prophase 2

-In Prophase 1, the cell is still in diploid form

Metaphase 1 v. 2

-In metaphase 1, homologous chromosomes (tetrads) pair up at the at the equator

-In metaphase 2, single chromosomes line up

-the cell is still in diploid form; metaphase 1

Anaphase 1 v. 2

-in Anaphase 1, the cell is still diploid

-in Anaphase 2, the splitting of the centromere takes place, where the tetrads are pulled apart

-Anaphase 1 just pulls the sister chromatids/tetrads to the opposite poles of the cell

**Crossing over:**

-means the exchange of corresponding segments between non sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes

-simple definition: when homologous chromosomes trade part

-the sites where the genetic material cross over is called a **chiasma(plural: _chiasmata)_-**the microscopically visible site where crossing over has occurred between chromatids of homologous chromosomes during prophase 1 of meiosis 

-begins very early in prophase 1 of meiosis

-the chromosomes are in a tetrad

-in humans, an average of one to three crossover events occur per chromosome pair

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Process of crossing over:</span>



1. The DNA molecules of two nonsister chromatids (one maternal and one paternal) breaks away
2. Immediately, the two broken chromatids join together in a new way (maternal to paternal and paternal to maternal)
1. The homologous sections of the chromosomes trade places/crossing over
2. This process produces hybrid chromosomes (in this case: maternal/paternal and paternal/maternal)
3. New combinations of maternal and paternal genes

       3.   Homologous chromosomes separate in anaphase 1



1. Each contains a new segment originating from its homolog

       4.   The sister chromatids during anaphase 2 separate



1. kEach separating sister chromatid goes to a different gene

**Genetic Recombination:**

-the production of gene combinations different from those carried by the original parental chromosomes



1. Exact meaning: the production, by crossing over and/or independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, of offspring with allele combinations different from those in the parents. 
2. The term can also be use to mean the production by crossing over of eukaryotic or prokaryotic chromosomes with gene combinations different from those in the original chromosomes

**Phases of Meiosis I:**

-first reduction division

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prophase 1:</span>

-nuclear envelope starts to dissolve

-DNA starts to condense

-centrosomes go to poles

-Homologous chromosomes tends to crossover



1. Adds more variation

Late Prophase: Chromosomes pair up

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Metaphase 1:</span>

-chromosomal crossover

-microtubules attach to the kinetochores of the chromosomes

-chromosome tetrads line up at the equator

-spindle fiber is attached to 1 homologous chromosomes

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Anaphase 1:</span>

-chromosomes start getting pulled apart

-**IN MEIOSIS I  SISTER CHROMATIDS DO NOT GET PULLED APART**



1. The sister chromatids stay together while homologous parts get pulled apart

-which pair gets on which side is random to add more to the variation

-tetrads split

-double chromosome move to opposite poles

-homologous chromosomes gets pulled apart

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Telophase 1:</span>

-Genetic material began to decondense into chromatin form

-nuclear membrane begins to form

-reversal of prophase 1

-microtubules dissolving

-then cytokinesis occurs

-the cleavage furrow beings to form

-spindle fiber disappear

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cytokinesis I:</span>

-each cell now has a haploid chromosome set

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Interphase 2: </span>



* A rest phase between the two meiosis phases
* Happens in **some **organisms and cells

**Phase of Meiosis II:**

-very similar to mitosis

-there is two cells from Meiosis I

-start with a haploid number and ends with a haploid number

-the end chromosomes in each gamete is not a homologous pair

-final phase of meiosis

-generally the same as Meiosis I but Meiosis II starts with haploid cells

-the two haploid cells go through another division to make sure that each cell has the same chromosome 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prophase 2:</span>

-nuclear envelope dissolves

-chromosomes condense (chromatin)

-centrosomes replicated

-centrosomes start to migrate to the poles of the cells

**CROSSING OVER DOES NOT OCCUR**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Metaphase 2:</span>

-centrosomes migrated to the poles

-condensed chromosomes are lined up on the equator

-microtubules attach to the chromosomes

-microtubules also start pushing each centrosome

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Anaphase 2:</span>

-sister chromatids gets pulled apart by the centrosomesâ microtubules

-the daughter chromosomes move to the opposite poles

-microtubules are connected to the kinetochores

-

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Telophase 2:</span>

-the cell start to elongate

-the cell start to pinch

-4 haploid daughter cells appear (each cell with 2 chromosomes)

-chromosomes begin to decondense into chromatin form

-cytokinesis

-nuclear envelope reforms

-microtubules begins to dissolve

-each of the daughter cells can be called gametes and have a haploid number of chromosomes

( \
-if there are 4 egg cells, only one of those four will be a functional egg cell, with the others being polar bodies

-in trees, the sperm would be within the pollen and an egg within an ovule \
)

**THINGS TO REMEMBER:**

-interphase is not part of meiosis

-crossing over occurs **ONLY **during prophase I



1. The complex that forms between homologous chromosomes is only present during prophase I

-meiosis does not occur in all cells



1. Gametes

-meiosis is important to, but not the same as, sexual reproduction



1. Meiosis is necessary for sexual reproduction to occur
2. Sexual reproduction includes fertilization, which is not part of meiosis

**Tetrad-**a group of chromosomes

-can be homologous chromosomes (mostly)

-breaks off to each new cell

-codes for the same thing

-new structure consisting of 4 chromatids aligned gene by genequor

**Nondisjunction-**when paired homologous chromosomes fail to separate properly during meiosis**:**

-an occasional mishap

-more in depth definition: an accident of meiosis or mitosis in which a pair of homologous chromosomes or a pair of sister chromatids fail to separate at anaphase

-the members of a chromosome pair fail to separate

-after a disjunction, one gamete receives two of the same type of chromosome and another gamete receives no copy of that chromosomes



1. The other chromosomes that are not involved with the nondisjunction are distributed normally

-trisomy can result from nondisjunction where there is an abnormally large count of chromosomes

-monosomy can also result from nondisjunction in which there is a lack of chromosomes

-Chromosome pairs fail to properly separate during meiosis or mitosis - > Chromosomal abnormalities

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Option 1:</span>

Occurs during Meiosis I

-occurs during anaphase I



1. Homologous pair are supposed to pull apart
2. If they do not pull apart, 2 gametes will have additional chromosomes while the two other have a monosomy 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Option 2:</span>

-Occurs during Meiosis II

-occurs during anaphase II



1. When sister chromatids fail to separate
2. Can result in 1 gamete having additional chromosomes while the other one having monosomy
3. The other two gametes are still functional

**Law of Independent assortment:**

-the homolo of one chromosome can be inherited with either homolog of a second chromosome

-the way that the homologous chromosomes line up in metaphase 1 will determine the diversity of the gametes

**Gender:**

-the father usually determines the gender

-23 is the autosome

-each female has two XX chromosomes, not allowing the mother to determine gender

-the father has two diploid chromosomes that are XY

-for the father, there will be two gametes with X and two with Y

-XX = female; XY = male

**Path of Meiosis in Female Humans:**



1. Diploid-Oogonium
2. Diploid-Primary Oocyte (Going to go through Meiosis 1, producing two haploid cells
3. Haploid-Polar Body; Secondary Oocyte (Then goes through Meiosis 2, there will be 3 polar bodies and 1 egg cell
4. Haploid-3 Polar Bodies (Did not received cytoplasm and organelles, and will be broken down, they also does not have the ability to be fertilized), 1 egg/ova (1 out of the four has the necessary cytoplasm and organelles that can be fertilized)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Oogenesis</span>

-means the beginning of making an egg

**Path of Meiosis in Male Humans:**

-the male is not born with every sperm that they will ever have

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Spermatogenesis: </span>

-sperm formation



1. Diploid-Spermatogonium
2. Diploid-Primary Spermatocyte
3. Haploid-Secondary Spermatocyte
4. Haploid-Spermatid
5. Haploid-Sperm (Male gametes arenât like females, that means the four sperm produced are all capable of fertilization

**Y Chromosome:**

-Does not show first, and X chromosomes show first

-SRY Gene to inhibit certain X chromosome functions, so the Y Chromosome can be shown more

-Nipples form before SRY Genes

-the Y chromosome does not appear for some time so gender can not be shown

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inheriting a mutation:</span>

-if the mutation resides in the gametes of the parents

-for example the cancerous skin cell was only found in the somatic cell

-so if the somatic cell has the gene, it would not go transfer to the offspring

**Why are we so unique?**

-the possible combination in an egg or a sperm are: 8,388,608

-the number of combinations in an offspring: 70, 368, 744, 177, 664

^does not take into account crossing over, so the number is way bigger^

-law of independent assortment

-us humans have 99.6% similar with the rest being unique

**Mistakes in Meiosis:**

-yes mistakes in Meiosis is possible

-can be of chromosomal numbers in the gametes

-rare in human combinations

-chromosomal abnormalities

-Turner Syndrome; 1 sex chromosome, but have a lower life expectancy and the X chromsome is doing the job of two X

-an extra chromosome, can lead to learning disabilities

-Y only permutation is fatal (XXY, XYY, etc)

-when the SRY gene is expressed on the X gene 

-the very ends of X and Y chromosomes can contain similar genes to switch

-gene migration, when the male phenotype is landed on the female phenotype it can lead ot complications (XX male)



1. Sterile

SRY Gene can determine fertility

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Chromosome Number</span>

-can be not obvious

-monosomy-lacking a chromosome 

-Trisomy-an additional chromosome

-sometimes is not determined by chromosome number

**Turnerâs Syndrome:**

-Monosomy

-only one X chromosome

-most 98% with this characteristic during development will spontaneously aboard; miscarriage

**Disomy:**

-two

-can be a problem if nondisjunction occurs

-Uniparental Disomy: Two homologs from one parent

-Can be silent or fatal

-very rare but can happen

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Uniparental Disomy</span>

-two copies of the chromosomes are from one parent

-Rare recessive disorder but still can arise; otherwise no physical anomalies

Examples:

-Prader-Willie Syndrome

-Angelman Syndrome

**Down Syndrome:**

-Trisomy 21

-Extra copy of the 21 chromosome

-Amniocentesis

-an extra chromosome is inherited on the 21st chromosome

-the severity can be different

-does not affect gender

-some have noticeable physical manifestations (flatter face, bigger face, very almond shaped eyes)

-mental manifestations: some can have high mental functions, some cannot have functions meaning their brain have been juvenile and suppressed; mental retardation 

-this results in 47 chromosomes

**Maternal Age:**

-woman are told to not conceive a child after 40

-men do not have a limit

-the reason woman have a age recommendation is because by the age of 40 the left over oogonium having a mutation is higher because the eggs are exposed to mutagens for most of the time

-the reason the male does not have an age restriction because males keep on reproducing those sperm cells

**Amniocentesis:**

-a needle is inserted to get some of the amniotic fluid to test and see the chromosomal numbers

-done while the mother is pregnant with the offspring

-to study the cells of the offspring

-to see the chromosome number

**Klinefelterâs Syndrome**

-the order is on the sex chromosome

-can have some female characteristics 

-men

-sterile; cannot produce viable gametes

-not fatal

**Triple X Syndrome**

-the extra X chromosomeâs origin is unknown

-a normal typical female does not have physical features

-most are fertile; able to reproduce

-normal sexual development

**Fertilization**

-the fusion of the egg & sperm

-restores the species # of chromosomes

-create a zygote (2n) 

-goes through mitotically to create necessary somatic cells

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Anatomy of the Egg</span>

-the egg has a jelly like out

-a egg plasma membrane

-a genetic material receptors

-

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Anatomy of the Sperm</span>

-the head of the sperm has the haploid genetic information has

-binds to certain receptors

-the genetic information can then make its way into the egg

-fertilization complete

-only the genetic material goes through

Acrosome: A specific job for one specie, and contains hydrolytic enzymes

-meant to penetrate the human female egg

-this enzyme is specific to the human egg

-the enzyme is specific (exceptions)

**External Fertilization:**

-when the fusion of gametes occurs outside of the body

-fish fertilize and develop outside of the body

-not protected

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">External Development:</span>

-the growing of the organism happens outside of the body

-birds develop externally 

-the parent has less parental care

**Internal fertilization:**

-the fusion of gametes occurs inside of the body

-humans develop and fertilize both internally

-protected

-birds fertilize internally

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Internal Development:</span>

-the growing of the organism happens inside of the body

**Sex Linked Traits in Humans:**

**X & Y Chromosomes:**

-most human traits are determined by genes that are carried on sex chromosomes



1. Most are located on the X chromosome

-the inheritance can be explained by how males who are XY passes down an XY chromosome to each daughter and a Y chromosome to each son

-on the other hand, females who are XX, pass down an X to both their son and daughter



1. If a son receives an X chromosome with a recessive allele, the recessive phenotype will be expressed because he does not inherit on the Y chromosome some from his father a dominant allele that would mask the expression of the recessive allele

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Problems:</span>**



1. Are all of your chromosomes full homologous?
2. A particular species of worm has a diploid number of 10. How many chromosomal combinations are possible for gametes formed by meiosis?
3. Describe how crossing over and the random alignment of homologous chromosomes on the metaphase I plate account for the genetic variation among gametes formed by meiosis.
4. What is Trisomy 21?

Down Syndrome; the presence of an extra chromosome (Humans with Down Syndrome will have 47 chromosomes instead of 46)



5. Explain how nondisjunction could result in a diploid gamete.
6. When does crossing over occur?
7. What is crossing over?
8. What is the result of meiosis?
9. What feature distinguishes prophase I of meiosis from prophase of mitosis?
10. A cell with a diploid number of 24 undergoes meiosis, how many chromosomes are in each daughter cell?
11. A scientist is interested in studying the event of crossing over (recombination) in mouse gametes. She wants to label some of the mouse DNA with fluorescent dyes to better visualize it. During what phase of the cell cycle should she look at these fluorescent DNA strands in order to most effectively study recombination?

Prophase I; Recombination or crossing over happens primarily in prophase I. In anaphase and telophase, the DNA strands are separated and cannot recombine. In metaphase, homologous chromosomes line up with each other, but do not recombine



12. Which of the following is false concerning mitosis and meiosis?

a.Both use the same order of events: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase

b.Both of these processes allow genetic variation

C. both processes require DNA synthesis beforehand

d.Meiosis results in a halving of chromosomes in the daughter cells, while mitosis reserves the same amount of genetic material in the daughter cells

B; Mitosis and meiosis share many procedural similarities, however, it is important to remember that mitosis makes identical copies while meiosis allows genetic variation between cells. Meiosis takes place in sex cells, which are capable of creating millions of different variations of offspring. Mitosis takes place in normal cells involved in growth and regeneration within a single, uniform organism



13. Which of the following highlights a key different between meiosis and mitosis?

a.Genetic mutations can only occur in meiosis; mitosis always results in identical daughter cells and parent cell

b.There is no metaphase stage in meiosis

c.Meiosis involves two division; mitosis involves one

d.All answer choices are correct

C; Meiosis includes two division (meiosis I and II), resulting in two pairs of haploid cells, while mitosis only involves a single division. Both share the same phase, but there are some differences, like crossing over (which is unique to meiosis)



14. What would result in a cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes after meiosis?

Nondisjunction; Crossing over or recombination, is a process that takes place in the earlier stages of meiosis and promotes genetic variation/diversity. While during recombination, genetic material is exchanged between two homologous chromosomes. The chromosomes ultimately contain the same amount of genetic material after recombination, and are properly separated during subsequent division. The cleavage of the protein securin is actually what allows the sister chromatids to separate, a process that is essential to maintaining the correct number of chromosomes in each daughter cell. Nondisjunction is the name given to the phenomenon in which separation f genetic material fails to occur. Either homologous chromosomes fail to separate properly in meiosis I, or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis I. The result of this nondisjunction events is one with an abnormal count of chromosomes; trisomy, and another cell with a abnormally low chromosome count; monosomy.

**Mitosis vs Meiosis:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mitosis:</span>

-diploid to diploid

-same genetic information in all offspring

-uses: repair, growth, and development

-does not strive for genetic variation

-somatic cells

-is a cycle

-genetically identical offsprings

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Meiosis:</span>

-diploid to haploid to haploid

-different genetic information in offspring

-sexual reproduction 

-uses: gamete production for sexual reproducing organisms

-strives for variation in the offspring

-has 2 phases (Meiosis I and II)

-not a cycle

-fertilization

-genetically unique offsprings

-starts with a germ cell


---

**Part 1, Mitosis:**

**Chromatin-**the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up eukaryotic chromosomes

-loose genetic material

-46

-the genetic material is in the form of chromatin when the cell is at rest or when the cell is just being the cell

-chromatin is made up of solenoid chromatin fiber which is then made of nucleosomes, histones, and the DNA helix

-the decondensed form is a good thing

-during cell division, Chromatin must become condensed (turning into a chromosome)

**Chromosome-**a gene carrying structure found in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell

**-**condensed genetic material

-Happens when the cell is getting ready for cell division

-Is made up of telomere, centromere, and the arm (structure)

-can be called chromatids

-can only be seen during cell division

-a single DNA molecule wrapped around proteins

-a chromosome consisting of one chromatid looks like this:

![alt_text](images/image26.jpg "image_tooltip")


-if sister chromatids are attached at the centromere, theyâre considered one chromosome

-during cell division, during the pull apart phase, each sister chromatid is considered an individual chromosome 

-copy of the original chromosome

**Homologous Pairs of chromosomes:**

-homologous chromosomes have the same gene at the same location on the chromosome

-chromosomes that code for the same gene at the same location

-DO NOT CONFUSE WITH SISTER CHROMATIDS

**Allele-**A specific version of a gene



* capital letter means the dominant allele (meaning it is easier to read)
* Lowercase letters means a recessive allele (meaning it is harder to read)

**Traits: **Specific physical manifestations of characteristics (ex. Eye color, hair color, height, etc.)

**Sex cells (gametes) do not have 46 chromosomes, but instead 23, a sperm and an egg will meet up to form 46 chromosomes.=:**

-have a haploid number of chromosomes

-has only 1 set of chromosomes



1. The reason that there is only 1 set, it means there will be too many chromosomes being passed down to the offspring

**Haploid & Diploid:**

A haploid cell is a cell that contains a single set of chromosomes (ex. Gametes/sex cells)

A diploid cell is a cell that contains two copies of each chromosome (ex. Somatic cells)

**Somatic cells are any cells that arenât the reproductive cells. This can be liver cells, skin cells, etc..**

**Syngamy-**

-fertilization

-the union of gametes

**Fertilization:**

-can be called syngamy

-the union of gametes

**Centrosome/centrioles:**

-a tube like organelle** **located in a cell that helps with cell division

-where the two sister chromosomes attach to each other

**Somatic Cells:**

-body cells

-diploids

-2 sets of chromosomes (2n, one from the father, one from the mother)

-humans are the only species that have 46 chromosomes as our diploid chromosomes

-the number of chromosomes vary for somatic cells among different species

-undergoes mitosis/mitotic division



1. One diploid divides into two genetically identical daughter cells
2. There are cells that cannot go through cell division frequently

**Karyotype:**

-image of chromosomes

-the arrangement of chromosomes from biggest to smallest that forms an image

-an image of the homologous pairs of chromosomes for a specific organism

-in order to get a karyotype



1. You need to find a cell that is currently in cell division otherwise the genetic material will not be condensed
2. Must be taken during the cell division process
3. Karyotype for humans feature 23 chromosomal pairs, with 1-22 being autosomes and the 23rd being the sex chromosome (determining gender)

**Autosomes:**

-chromosomes that code for your body cells/somatic cells

-Pairs 1-22 are autosomes:

-a specific geneâs location along the length of a chromosomes

**Centrosome:**

-spindle microtubules emerge from the two centrosomes

-it serves as the attachment site for microtubules

-seen in animal cells

-made up of 27 microtubules



1. Extends outwards during cell division to pull chromosomes apart

**Pre-cell division: **The cell must grow the cytoplasm, the cell membrane and to also duplicate certain organelles so both daughter cells get the correct amount of organelles

**Cell division:**

-in multicellular organisms it allows for growth, replacement of damaged cells, and development of an embryo into an adult

-two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis

-the 2 âdaughterâ cells are genetically identical to the âparentâ cell

-before the cell splits, it must duplicate its chromosome 

-sometimes cell division can result in the formation of a whole new organism

-asexual reproduction 



1. Many single celled, prokaryotic cells, and/or the eukaryotic yeast cell reproduce by dividing in half 
2. This means the offspring is a genetic copy of the parent
3. This is known as asexual reproduction, the creation of genetic identical offsprings from one parent cell without sperm and egg
1. Some multicellular organisms can also perform asexual reproduction
2. One example for this is the sea star species 
3. The one simple rule behind asexual reproduction of inheritance is: the lone parent and each of its offspring have identical genes 

-the other type of reproduction is sexual reproduction



1. This type of reproduction requires the fertilization of an egg by a sperm
2. This involves the creation of gametes in a special type of cell division that is only found within reproductive organs
3. For humans, these organs are known as testes and ovaries
4. Gametes only have half the chromosomes as the parent cell that gave rise to it
1. These chromosomes contains unique combinations of genes 
2. This means offspring generally resemble their parents than their resemblance with unrelated parents
3. This does not mean the offspring is identical to their parents (exception for identical twins)

       5.    Each offspring inherits a unique combination of genes from its 2 parents



1. This means that this one and only set of gene programs a unique combination of traits 
2. This means there is greater variation for sexual reproduction 

-besides reproduction, cell division enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from a single cell (zygote)



1. This means all the cells in your body arose from one cell that was from the cell division in your motherâs body

-when an organism has developed fully, cell division plays a role in repair and renewal of cells and other 



1. For example your skin cells replace dead cells that will eventually drop from the top of your skin

-there are mainly two types of cell division:

-**SOME CELLS TEND TO NOT DIVIDE, AN EXAMPLE IS NEURONS**

**Mitosis-**the type of cell division in multicellular organisms that is reponsible for maintenance and cell division along with asexual reproduction 

-not to be confused with meiosis which involves sperm and egg

-creates diploid cells

-offspring is genetically identical to its parent and each other

-for growth, repair, and development

-all organisms perform mitosis 

-examples of cells that do not perform mitosis: nerve cells, spinal cells



1. These cells do not divide because it can damage memories, like brain cells and nerve cells which can therefore harm things.
2. Heart cells are 24/7 meaning it can be lethal for cell division to take place
3. Mitosis is found and utilized by most asexual reproducing organisms

**Meiosis-**the type of cell division that is responsible for the creation of most gametes

-creates haploid cells

-reduces the number of chromosomes by half

-is necessary for sexual reproduction

-begins with a diploid parent cell

-genetically unique from one another and the parent cell

![alt_text](images/image29.png "image_tooltip")


**Cytokinesis-**the dividing and separation of the cytoplasm from the parent cell

-happens at the end of mitosis and meiosis

**Binary fission-**a means by which a parent organism divides into 2 genetically identical, individuals of equal size

-prokaryotes reproduce by this method



1. The majority of genes are carried on a singular circular DNA molecule w/ associated proteins associates the organismâs chromosome 
2. Prokaryotic chromosomes are typically smaller than eukaryotic chromosomes
3. But with this, it is still a formidable challenge to divide this genetic material into 2 (for example E. Coli.âs unwinded genetic material is 500 times longer than the cell itself)

-Involves the distribution of a copy of the single parental chromosome to each daughter cell

-Process of binary fissions goes like this:



1. Duplication of the chromosome and separation of the copies

    -as the chromosome is duplicating, the copies move toward the opposite end of the cell

2. Continued elongation of the cell and movement of the copies

    -elongation of the cell

3. Division into 2 daughter cells

    -when chromosome duplication is complete and the cell has reached about twice its initial size, the plasma membrane grows inward and more cell wall is made, which eventually divides the parent cell into two daughter cells 


**Eukaryotic cell cycle **

-eukaryotes are generally more complex and larger than prokaryotes, and sometimes with eukaryotes having more genes than prokaryotes



1. For example human cells carry under 21,000 genes
2. Bacterium on the other hand has around 3,000 genes for a typical bacterium

-for eukaryotes, almost all of the genes are found within a cellâs nucleus, which there are then grouped into multiple chromosomes 

-

**Gene-**the units of information that specify an organismâs inherited traits

**Clone-**a group of genetically identical individuals 

**Life cycle-**the generation-to-generation sequences of stages in the reproductive history of an organism

Auto

**Function vs Life Span:**

-the ability of the cell can control the lifespan of the cell

-There are some white blood cells that will stay with you for years that will remember how to defend a foreign pathogen



1. There are 5 classes of white blood cells with many different subdivisions
2. All have their function and life span

-Damage to important parts of the body, like the spinal cord and/or heart can leave long-term harm due to the lack of cell division that can happen on those cells

-**MOST NERVE CELLS CANNOT DIVIDE**

-cells like in the esophagus and the digestive tract have a lot cell division because they are always exposed to things that can cause them damage; **high cell turnover rate**

-cancer cellâs lifespan typically depends on the cancer type

-cancer cells have a high cell division rate

**Cell Cycle:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Interphase:</span>

-in between each phase, the cell would check if it has done the correct thing

-nucleus, nuclear envelope, and nucleolus are visible

-underdeveloped centrosomes



1. Only in animal cells

-chromatin visible

-you do not see replication of organelles and genetic material

-Gap Zero (G0), when the cell is being the cell:



1. Genetic material is loose
2. Some cells like cardiac cells can stay in this phase for their entire life
3. White blood cells can stay in G0 for weeks

-G1:



1. Cell gets larger 

-S-Phase:



1. S stands for synthesis
2. Replication of DNA

-G2:



1. Cell growth
2. Organelles Replicates
3. After this there will be no more checks

-Then mitosis



1. Has phases in the order of: Prophase->Metaphase->Anaphase->Telophase
2. M-Phase

-Cytokinesis 



1. Means cytoplasmic division where the cell separates into two
2. M-Phase

-After cytokinesis, the two daughter cells go straight into G0

-**THE CELL DOES NOT PERFORM ITS NORMAL FUNCTION DURING CELL DIVISION**



1. One reason is that the genetic material is condensed and harder to read

**MITOSIS CYCLE:**

Remembering the phases:

Prophase: Prepare

Metaphase: Middle

Anaphase: Apart

Telophase: Terminate/Tear

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prophase:</span>

-Has two parts: Early Prophase and Late Prophase



1. Late prophase is sometimes called prometaphase
2. In early prophase, the centrosomes start to move away from each other and spindle fibers starts to develop between them (microtubules)
3. From late prophase to early prophase, the nuclear membrane disappears
4. In late prophase, you can see: Sister Chromatids, Spindle Fibers, Kinetochore, 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Metaphase:</span>

-Spindle Fibers fully mature (b/c theyâre connected to chromosomes and each other)

-Sister chromatids are in single file at the equator

-poles at opposite ends of the cell

-centromeres of all chromosomes are lined up on the metaphase plate

-the kinetochores of the two sister chromatids are attached to microtubules from opposite poles

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Anaphase:</span>

-begins with the two centromeres of each chromosome coming apart, separating them

-Sister chromatids pull apart because microtubules are shortening

-Cell will divide in the horizontal plane

-Chromosome number goes up by x2

-motor proteins of the kinetochores powered by ATP âwalkâ the newly separated daughter chromosomes centromere first along the microtubules toward opposite poles of the cell



1. the kinetochores depolymerize the microtubules, which results in the breakdown of the microtubule into tubulin subunits. This effectively shrinks the microtubule, resulting in the chromatids moving towards the centrosome

-the spindle microtubules that are not attached to the chromosomes lengthen resulting in the cell becoming elongated

-by the end of anaphase, at the end of each side of the cell there will be an equal collection of chromosomes

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Telophase:</span>

-Opposite of Prophase

-Chromosomes uncoil to chromatin (DNA begins to relax)

-Microtubules (spindle fibers) disappear

-Nucleus envelope returns/forms

-Nucleolus returns

-Cleavage furrow forms

-the pinching motion (in) separates the cell (for plant cells, something different happens

-as soon as the cleavage furrow forms starts, cytokinesis begins explaining why telophase is often pictured together with cytokinesis

-by the end of telophase, chromatin fibers uncoil, and the mitotic spindle disappears

-happens closely/overlapping with cytokinesis

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cytokinesis:</span>

-division of the cytoplasm

-occurs simultaneously with telophase

-two daughter cells separate soon after the end of mitosis

-in animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms and the cell pinches into two

**Cleavage Furrow:**

-The first sign of cytokinesis during cell division in an animal cell; a shallow groove in the cell surface near the old metaphase plate

**Mitotic Spindle:**

-A football-shaped structured formed of microtubules and associated proteins that is involved in the movement of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis

-guides the separation of the two sets of daughter chromosomes

-emerges from the **centrosomes**

**Cytokinesis: plant cells vs animal cells:**

-the main reason that it is different is because of how plant cells have a stiff cell wall

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In Animal Cells:</span>

-Pinching of the cell membrane

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In Plant cells:</span>

-A cell plate forms to divide the two cells

**IF GENETIC MATERIAL AND PROPER CELL CYCLE HASNâT HAPPENED, CYTOKINESIS CAN STILL HAPPEN BUT ONE CELL WOULD LACK CERTAIN MATERIALS.**

**Kinetochore-**a place where spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes (a specific spot)

**Tumors:**

-tumor cells do not love the red and yellow cell

-a mass of abnormally dividing cells near normal tissue

-tumor does not necessarily mean cancer

-cells have growth regulators but if they go rogue they can become tumor cells when they also loose their regulator

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Benign tumor-</span>a mass of abnormally growing cells that arenât moving anywhere in the body (localized & not spreading throughout the body)

Metastasis-cancer cells that are spreading, which:

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Malignant tumor-</span>cancer cells, and they are metastasizing and their tumor cells are travelling throughout the body

**Asexual Reproduction:**

-involves 1 parent

-involves a cell division known as mitosis

-produces genetically identical daughter cells

-no gametes involved

-rapid/fast 

-lacks variation in the offsprings



1. This results in the offspring being able to carry mutations into the next
2. 

-primary form of reproduction in unicellular organisms (protists, bacteria, and some fungi [yeast])

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Types of Asexual Reproduction:</span>



1. Binary Fission
2. Vegetative Propagation
3. Spore Formation [Sporulation]
4. Budding
5. Fragmentation (ex. Star Fish)
6. Parthenogenesis (ex. Unfertilized egg developing fully without meeting of gametes)

**Binary Fission:**

-one parent splits into two equal parts

-in many prokaryotes and some eukaryotes

-bacteria and protists use this

**Vegetative Propagation:**

-parts of the parent organism are detached and develop into new individuals that are identical to the parent plant

-new independent organisms are formed without seeds or spores

-clonal colony

-can be modified for feasible traits in plants by modifying the genetic materials of that plant

**Spore Formation:**

-small body made from one individual capable of giving rise to a new individual without sexual fusion

-very resilient against unfavorable elements

-easily dispersed

-common in lower plants, fungi, some protists

-sporulation

-the spores are dispersed by the parent

**Budding:**

-parent organism divides into unequal parts by way of an outgrowth or bud

-bud grows while still attached to parents and then separates

Examples:



1. Yeast
2. Hydra

**Fragmentation:**

-new organism grows from a fragment of the parent

-can be intentionally or not

Examples:



1. Worms
2. Fungi
3. Plants
4. Sponges

**Regeneration:**

-replacing parts of an organism and creating new individuals organisms in the process

**Difference between Regeneration and Fragmentation:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fragmentation:</span>

Organisms that are fragmented result in each fragment growing into an individual organism

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regeneration:</span>

Regeneration occurs when an organism wants to regrow a lot limb or any other part of the body

**Parthenogenesis:**

-when an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual

-can be genetically similar but not identical

-this process only produces females

Examples:



1. Plants
2. Bees
3. Ants
4. Fish
5. Sharks
6. Komodo Dragons
7. Some species of birds

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Haploid Parthenogenesis:</span>

Meiosis -> Oocyte (n/Haploid) -> Haploid Zygote (n) -> Develops into haploid individual

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diploid Parthenogenesis</span>

Automixis

Meiosis -> Oocyte (n) -> 1. Chromosomal replication (2n) or 2. Fuse with other oocyte (n+n) -> Diploid Zygote (2n) -> develops into diploid individual

Apomixis

Mitosis -> Female Egg Cell (2n) -> Diploid Egg (2n) -> develops into diploid individual

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">PROBLEMS:</span>**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Questions:</span>**



1. What function does cell division play in an amoeba (a single celled protist)? What function does it play in your body?
2. Why is binary fission classified as asexual reproduction?
3. You view an animal cell through a microscope and observe dense, duplicated chromosomes scattered throughout the cell. Which state of mitosis are you witnessing?
4. Contrast cytokinesis in animals with cytokinesis in plants.
5. Why did sexual reproduction appear later than asexual reproduction?
6. Do all cells complete the cell cycle in the same amount of time?
7. Describe how enzymes control the cell cycle.
8. How can disruption of the cell cycle result in cancer?
9. How does cancer affect normal cell functioning?
10. Why is it necessary for a cellâs chromosomes to be distributed to its daughter cells in such a precise manner?

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do now #1:</span>**

**Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes:**

The main difference between the two is that Eukaryotic cells have membrane bound organelles along with a nucleus while prokaryotic cells do not.

**Function of the nucleus:**

The regulator of the cell and where genetic material is stored

**Nucleolus:**

Storage of RNA, located in the nucleus

**Difference between a liver cell & skin cell:**

They are the same for the genetic material part as they are necessary to make who you are you

**Difference between a liver cell & sperm cell:**

They are different for genetic information because the sperm cell carries half of the genetic information as it needs to meet up with the egg which has the other half; sex cell.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do now #2:</span>**

**What a cell need to do to divide**



1. Replicate DNA
2. Before a cell divides, it needs to grow (cell growth of the cytoplasm, cell membrane, and organelles need to replicate) 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do now #3:</span>**

    -Down syndrome

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do now #4:</span>**



1. What are different phases of the cell cycle?

-G0

-G1

-S Phase

-G2

-M Phase{PMAT}: Cytokinesis



2. What are the components of interphase so important to cell division

The cell grows and DNA is replicated



3. What is the goal of Mitotic Cell Division?

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do now #5:</span>**



1. What would happen if the cell cycle occurred without the S-Phase?

DNA would not be replicated



2. What would go wrong if the cell cycle occurred without mitosis?

Genetic material and other important components would not be able to be passed on to each offspring. If the cell then managed to divide, one offspring would lack a nucleus and proper genetic materials.



3. What would go wrong if the cell cycle occurred without cytokinesis?

The cells at the end of the cell cycle would not be able to divide into 2. Meaning the cell would have 2 nucleus and 2 sets of genetic material.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Important Acronym:</span> Mr. Stranger** - **M**etabolism, **R**espiration, **S**ynthesis, **T**ransport, **R**eproduction, **N**utrition, **G**rowth, **E**xcretion, **R**egulation 

There are however 8 necessaries or must life functions

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Important notes:</span>**

-An arrow in a chemical equation means âyieldâ or âwill produceâ but never use âequalâ

-Respiration takes place in a cellâs mitochondria

-Reproduction is not necessary for the survival of an individual organism, but instead is responsible for the survival of the entire species.

-Breathing is not the same as respiration

-Mitosis increases the amount of cells

-Excretion only takes place for the removal of gaseous or liquid waste via the excretory system (e.g. lungs, kidneys, skin, etc.)

-The dependent variable is the y-axis and the independent variable is the X axis

-Anaerobic: no o2, 2 atp | Aerobic: uses o2, ~36 ATP

**Regulation **

Mechanisms that keep an organismâs internal environment within specific limits.

**Response**

The response to stimuli in the environment

**Reproduction**

New individual organisms are produced from their parent(s)

There are two types of reproduction:

Asexual 

Sexual

____

**_Evolution  - change over time_**

_Occurs at the level of a population _

_(This is not an individual characteristic_

____

_Viruses are not living organisms because they cannot replicate without a host, they are not made up of cells, and they canât make their own energy_

Prokaryote has an outer membrane (cell wall) under it, is the cell membrane, and inside of that can be DNA or RNA (genetic material)

_COVID does not respond to a stimulus_

**Life processes (activities)**

(Every living thing must carry out these functions, BUTâ¦ do they complete them in the same way?)

-**Metabolism**- All [the sum of] of the chemical reactions that occur in a living organism

Oxygen + Glucose -> Carbon Dioxide + ATP + Water

Respiration-a chemical process that allows an organism to use food energy to get ATP energy - Use of food energy (glucose) and converts it into usable energy for the cell (ATP) (There are two types of respiration - Anaerobic (No use of O2 and only 2 ATP) and Aerobic respiration (Uses O2 and ~36 ATP)** respiration happens in a cellâs mitochondria**

Transport-movement/circulation of materials (blood, O2, glucose, water) throughout an organism

Ex.

Human -> Circulatory System

**Plant -> Xylem and the Phloem**

Unicellular -> Cytoplasm 

(Active Transport and Passive Transport are not part of Transport in this way)

Synthesis - (To make) making larger complex molecules from smaller ones.

Amino Acids -> Protein

Reproduction - the making of a new organism (s) from the parent(s)

Types of Reproduction - Asexual vs Sexual

Asexual - 1 parent, Makes a genetic clone

Sexual - 2 parents

Nutrition - the different processes and management of nutrients

Photosynthesis - Carbon Dioxide + Water -> (In the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll) Glucose + Oxygen (Chemical Equation)

Heterotroph: Ingestion, Egestion (does not mean the same thing as excretion), Digestion, 

Synthesis makes something larger

The two types of cell division: Mitosis and Meiosis 

Mitosis allows the number of cells to grow

Excretion, the removal of harmful cellular waste, that is either going to be in gaseous or liquid form. Organs: Skin, Kidneys, 

Stomata is where a plant excretes.

All organisms need to excrete as a life process.

The regulation allows an organism to respond to a stimulus.

Regulation is achieved by the nervous system and the endocrine system.

Plants have hormones, but not as the ones we have.

**Respiration-the taking in of water and glucose to form ATP **

**Excretion-the removal of harmful substances(e.g. Water, co2) from the body via excretory systems.**

**Both of them are related because they both release a gaseous waste and a liquid waste.**

**The source of lifeâs connections?**

**All living cells are going to have genetic material, usually in the form of DNA or maybe RNA.**

**-The genetic material tells the cell what to do.**

**Types of genetic traits;**

**-blood type**

**-hair color**

**-eye color**

**-genetic diseases (diabetes, cancer, etc.)**

All living thing (most) must have a common ancestor and then changed over time creating the [tree of life](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fwUociBqL._AC_SY741_.jpg) 

**Evolution by means of Natural Selection**

âSpecies arise through a process of descent with modificationâ

Natural Selection determines if an organism survives and will be able to reproduce.

Keywords in Darwinâs findings:

Variation

Adaptations

If the most adapted species survive, they will be known as âfitâ

Each adaptation creates a web of interactions that support one another on a larger scale.

Charles Darwin is most known for his discovery of the Galapagos Island.

Food chain features one pathway, while a food web is must more intricate and features much more pathways than a food chain (all food chains connected)

A community only features living things

Ecosystem features both living things and non-living things 

___

-The atomic mass is Neutrons **plus **protons 

-The atomic number is the number of protons

-In Biology, the number of electrons per ring is 2, 8, 8, 18 (in chemistry it is 2, 8, 18*, 32)

-Always round the atomic mass to the nearest whole number

-Most elements in the periodic table are shown in a neutral state

-If there is a neutral atom, the # of protons will equal the number of electrons

-Hydrogen has a atomic mass equal to its atomic number with exception.

-Electrons are the smallest particle in an atom

-About 25 elements are believed to be essential to humans, including elements that are required only in trace amounts.

-With electrons on the surface, atoms repel one another when they come too close. Thus, electrons determine the space that an atom occupies.

-The outer occupied shell is the valence shell, and outer shells hold electrons at higher energy than inner shells.

-The number of protons defines a chemical element. The number of neutrons and electrons can differ among atoms of the same element.

-The atomic nucleus becomes unstable if the ratio of protons to neutrons is too far rom unity.

-The first ring of electrons must be filled (with exception to hydrogen) exceeding the limit of 2 would mean it is not correct; Bohr Model

-electrons in valence shells are necessary to determine the stability of an atom.

-AMU = Atomic Mass Unit

-Whatâs on the other side of a chemical equation must be on both sides

-The interaction between a nearby atom depends on the amount of electrons in their valence shell

-Carbon-4 bonds-4 electrons in valence shell

-Covalent Bond - Sharing of (valence) electrons

-Ionic Bond - Transferring (1 or more) electrons; opposite charges

- (-) 1 pair (2) | (=) 2 pair (4) | (three lines) 3 pair (6)

-atoms that are ionically bonded are called **salts**

-atoms that are covalently bonded are called **molecules **

-it takes a lot of energy to break hydrogen bonds so thatâs why going from phase to phase takes a long time and energy.

**-**Atoms fill the outer shell (valence shell) with electrons so it could be more stable.

All nonliving and living things are made up of matter.

There are 3 states of matter on earth: gas, liquid, and solid

But there is more:plasma & BEC (Bose Einstein Condensate).

Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, & Hydrogen are found most abundantly in living things.

Biomolecules-molecules in living things (remember the bio prefix means life) 

Molecule-when two neighboring atoms begin to interact and share in which they bond together.

Goiter-Develops after an iodine deficien cy 

Percent of a human body: 65% Oxygen, 18.5% Carbon, 9.56% Hydrogen, 3.3% Nitrogen, 1.5% calcium

Trace element-element(s) that is present in a living thing, but is less than 0.01%.

For many of these elements, they can be naturally found within the body, but for the most part we have to consume food to get the extra elements.

(Goiter is the lack of iodine in diet)

(Element-pure substance that consists entirely of one type of atom)

Atomic weight-atomic mass; the atomic weight is going to be larger than the atomic number.

**Important: for biology class, round atomic weight to the nearest whole number**

The atomic number is always less than the atomic weight (with exception to hydrogen).

**What determines the identity of an element?**

The number of **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">protons</span>**

In an atom, two types of atoms hang out in the nucleus(protons and neutrons), while one spins around the nucleus (electron). Protons and neutrons have a greater mass than electrons.

-the mass of an atom is really based on the number of protons and neutrons (in the nucleus)

-atoms are electrically neutral

Protons-P

Neutrons-N

Electrons-e-

Electrons are constantly moving in the orbital shell.

The protons and neutrons are in the nucleus.

-electrons are randomly moving around the nucleus 

-there are a lot of empty space between the nucleus and the orbiting electrons

-protons are positive, neutrons are neutral, electrons are negative

**The electrons determine the interactions of atoms with one another**

**Atoms are electrically neutral if protons and electrons are equal in amount**

-when there is a plus sign in an elementâs name, it means there is more protons than electrons, with negative being the opposite, and no signs being equal

-a positive and a negative charge in two elements will cancel out to turn a compound into a neutral compound 

**Atomic Number: Protons**

**Atomic Mass: Neutrons and Protons**

**Atoms of the same element (isotope) that have a different number of neutrons:**

**-Can be radioactive (isotopes)**



1. 
Nucleus is very unstable (from the extra weight from the extra neutron) & will break down at a constant rate over time.

![alt_text](images/image33.png "image_tooltip")
Notice the only difference is the amount of neutrons present

**The rows in the periodic table are determined by the amount of electrons in the valence shell.**

**The sharing of electrons, transfer of electrons, and/or opposite charges keeps two atoms togetherA	**

The interaction of two or more atoms staying close together is held by an attraction known as the chemical bond



* 
Two ore mor **different **types of atoms joins together by a bond


* 
Crystal salt is help together by opposite charges 
**Compounds-**composed of two or more types of atoms 

(The bent shape of a water molecule is caused by the negativity of the lone electrons)

The versatility & reactivity of an atom depends on the balance of electrons in the valence shell.

Anywhere something isnât labelled itâs carbon; Carbon Rings

**Carbon:**

-Carbon is a stable element

-Found in many chemical compounds

-Carbon has four valence electrons

**Ionic Bonds**-The attraction between oppositely charged ions (made from one or more electrons being transferred from one to atom to another atom)

-there is at least one element that wants to transfer an electron to another element

-if an electron is being transferred and accepted it is an ionic bond

-an attraction between two opposite charges

-a salt is anything that is bounded ionically 

**Ion-**atom with a charge that is not equal to the number of protons and electrons

(Neutrons does not affect ions, but instead affect isotopes)

When a sodium ion gives a chlorine ion an electron, it turns the chlorine into a chloride; ionic bond.

(Electrostatic Attraction)

Ionic bond (own words): when one ion donates/transfers some electrons to another ion that will accept it, turning them into into oppositely charged particles that will be attracted to each other.

**Covalent Bonds-**electrons are shared by atoms, this means no one is transferring, accepting, and giving electrons, so no ions are formed. 



* 
If things join covalently they are called molecules


* 
When they join covalently, they would have more energy

**Single Bond-**one line between two atoms where only one pair (2) of electrons are shared between two atoms

**Double Bond-**two lines between two atoms where two pairs (4) of electrons are shared

**Triple Bond-**three lines between two atoms where three pairs (6) of electrons are shared

**Drawing something about bonds should be all about the electrons! (This means you can just draw a circle for the nucleus.**

**Atoms can never share more than 3 electrons, this means there is no quadruple bonds.**

Hydrogen is very unique (1 electron, 1 proton, & no neutrons)

There is no way to tell if a structural formula is supposed to be either vertical or linear.

**Atoms in a covalently bonded molecule continually compete for shared electrons**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Oxygen is one of the most electronegative elements</span>**(meaning it well have the greatest pulling power of shared electrons

Nonpolar- covalent bonds with equal pull on either element (for the shared electron(s)); equal tug of war

Polar- Covalent bond in which shared electrons are pulled closer to the more electronegative atom; tug of war is unequal [note: charge difference at the poles] This results in a boomerang shape.

**Electronegativity- **the tendency for an atom to attract shared electrons

-Waterâs polarity gives rise to unusual properties

Hydrogen likes to bond with O, F, N

-A hydrogen bond is the **weak **electrical attraction between a hydrogen atom with a partial positive charge and partially negative neighboring atom.

-Water has 4 partial charges

-The four different charges in a water molecule gives it special abilities

-One water molecule is joined together by polar covalent bonds

-multiple water molecules are joined by hydrogen bonds

-Oxygen is a much more electronegative than hydrogen

-each hydrogen molecule can bond to four other molecules of water

-Hydrogen bonds are weak individually but very strong when bonded

-Hydrogen bonds are represented by 3 dots

The number of electrons in its outer orbit determines that atomâs **chemical properties.**

**An atom with grater atomic mass would have more electron shells**

**Drawing a hydrogen bond is 3 dots **

Properties of Water:

**Cohesion-**when molecules of the same substance are attracted to each other

**Adhesion-**molecules of two different substances are attracted to one another

Water has a high surface tension

There is a meniscus is because the water molecules are attracted to the sides of the container

**High Heat Capacity - **measure of the heat energy required to raise the temperature of a specific volume of water by a fixed amount

	Why?

**Because of hydrogen bonding, water has a high resistance to temperature change than most substances**

**When water is in a liquid state the bonds are breaking and reforming**

**Solid-Confined Area and state and they do not move **

**Gas-move**

Why does ice float?

-Water is less dense and has less energy when it is in a solid state versus a liquid state 

-a given mass of liquid water occupies more space when it turns to ice

-ice hydrogen bonds are stable

-liquid hydrogen bonds constantly break and re-form

**Aqueous Solutions:**

-Solute

-> Substance being dissolved(hydrophilic-water loving) (think salt, sugar, coffee)

-> has to be capable of being dissolved

-Solvent

-> Dissolving agent (think water)

-In order for a solution to exist there must be a solvent and a solvent at least.

-NaCl is soluble in water

-Some substances dissolve if they are non polar or polar or a salt.

-Water loves to interact with polar and salts

-Oil is a huge non polar molecule, it will not interact with water.

-Salt is hydrophilic

-Oil is hydrophobic 

Dissociate-when salts and ions split into smaller particles (NaCl with water)

**Hydrophilic-**water loving

**Hydrophobic-**not water loving

-Water can dissolve ionic compounds(salts), polar covalent molecules(sugar) and *small nonpolar molecules. Cannot dissolve large, nonpolar molecules (ex. oil)

Notice that in this dissociation of NaCl with water, the Na+ particle is attracting the oxygen side of water molecules, and the Cl- particle is attracting the hydrogen side of water.

Blowing (Co2) into water will turn into Carbonic Acid (H2CO3) which also lowers its pH (more acidic).



* 
As the amount of CO2 rises in the atmosphere it can turn water into acidic liquids


* 
Carbon Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrous dioxide can all contribute to lowering the pH levels of lakes, etc. which kills many aquatic life.

-Buffer is when a substance maintains a pH by neutralizing hydrogen ions

**Compared to a solution of a pH 3, a solution of pH 1 is 100 times more acidic**

-there is something in a body that maintains the pH 

-when an acid is mixed with a base, a neutralization reaction takes place. (e.g. salt and water are produced as well)

-Buffers (weak acids an its conjugate base or vice versa) prevent sharp dramatic changes in pH

-human body has a narrow pH range (7.35-7.45) if it goes down, there will be serious consequences. Carbonic acid is present in the blood will bond and make the blood from base to acid, vice versa.

-Our bodyâs buffer system is called the The Bicarbonate buffer system

-pH change in your body can be fatal and can last forever

**Important: The order/sequence of amino acids determines the polypeptideâs shape which determines the function of a protein**

**Proteins:**

-twenty different amino acids are used to create an amino acids

-the main backbone of every amino acid is show below



1. 
The primary structure ultimately determines the shape of a protein, which determines its function


2. 
-in most proteins, parts of the polypeptide chain are coiled or folded, forming twists and corrugation
B. secondary structure results from hydrogen bonding between atoms along the polypeptide backbone

-superimposed on primary and secondary structure is tertiary structure



3. 
The irregular folding of tertiary structure results from interactions among the R groups of amino acids


4. 
Can be further stabilized by strong covalent bonds between sulfur atoms in certain R groups
-some proteins consist of two or more polypeptide chains

-the first and second structure arenât technically a protein until up to the tertiary structure level

-secondary-the result of the hydrogen bonding between alpha helix or pleated sheets

-in the tertiary structure certain R groups are going to interact creating a globular shape

-some proteins go to the quaternary structure, when two polypeptide chains bind together (for example hemoglobin) 

A sickle cell is the form that shows a disorder that someone has a lack of hemoglobin in their system.



* 
One letter in the DNA is switched out
**Enzymes**

-a protein that serves as a chemical catalyst 

-enzymes are only meant to react/fit with only one kind of substrate (shape)

-changing the pH and/or the temperature of the environment might not make an enzyme work.

-The shape and structure of an enzyme relates to its function because of the specific shape of the active site on the enzyme relating with how a substrate unit fits in.

**Factors that affect enzyme rxns:**

Temperature-optimal (human) 36-40 Celsius 

pH-optimal (for most, but not all) 6-8

Salt Concentration-interference with the chemical bonding and the overall 3 dimensional shape

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">A tour of the cell</span>

Cells together make up tissues, which makes up organs.

-there are cells you can see with your naked eye, you can see leaf cells

**Cell Theory**

-all living things are composed of cells or just a cell (providing structure and function)



1. 
An organism with multiple cells is called multicellular, while composed of only one is called a unicellular 


2. 
a unicellular organism is not as complex as a multicellular


1. 
There are more unicellular organisms than your own cells.
-all cells comes from other cells (comes from preexisting cells, which means they did not come from nothing)



1. 
Either from cellular division or reproduction
-all cells have genetic information in them; DNA/RNA

-all cells have an outer component, like a cell wall or membrane 

mm-millimeters

Âµm-micrometers (the measurement used under the microscope) 

nm-nanometers



1. 
Viruses are smaller than the smallest bacteria


2. 
You can see some muscle and nerve cells
Cell size limitation

-cell size must be large enough to house organelles, but small enough to allow for surface-to-volume ratio to allow exchange from envât

-the larger the cell, the smaller the surface to volume ratio

-if a cell gets too large, the surface to volume ratio would be too great for materials to get through the membrane

-the tinier the cell the better it can communicate between the environment and the cell, while being large makes the cell not able to exchange materials efficiently

Domain-archaea, eukarya, and bacteria

Kingdom

Phylum

Class

Order

Family

-Life is divided into three main domains above^^^

-there are two types of cells: eukaryotic and prokaryotic



1. 
Prokaryotic were the first that existed


2. 
A eukaryotic cell evolved from a prokaryotic cell


3. 
Prokaryotic are much more smaller and simpler


4. 
Both types of cells have cytoplasms, cell membrane, genetic material, ribosomes, but the eukaryotic cell has a nucleus while a prokaryotic cell lacks a nucleus 


5. 
Eukaryotic cells have a organelles that are membrane bound


1. 
Meaning the organelles have their own membranes
-you will never find a bacteria or archaea with an eukaryotic cell

-eukarya is the only domain that contains eukaryotic cells (ex. Plants, fungi, animals, protists)

-eukarya tends to be multicellular organisms 

-prokaryotic cells came first

-the human cell that has a flagella is the sperm cell

**DNA (prokaryote version)**

-single circular chromosome coiled into region called nucleoid ânucleus likeâ

**Semifluid (prokaryote version of the cytoplasm)**

-equivalent to cytosol of eukaryotes

**Ribosomes **

-different from moleculary from prokaryotes to eukaryotes

(ribosome helps make protein)

-an antibiotic targets prokaryotic ribosomes 

-an antibiotic does not kill viruses, instead an antiviral medicine kills viruses

**Plasma Membrane**

-protects the cell

**Cell Wall**

-peptidoglycan- proteins and glycogen 

**Capsule (not all prokaryotes have this)**

-a sticky coat helping to glue surface to other cells or colonies

**Conjugation**

-how two cells interact and possibly transmit materials between them

**Pili**

-pathogenic

**Fimbriae**

-allows the cell to attach to the surface of something that is different from itself

**Flagella**

-a structure that both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have but they are different at a molecular level

-The nucleus contains the nucleolus 

The nucleus has two membranes!

-the nuclear pores allows substances to enter and exit the nucleus

-the genetic/ information (DNA) is protected inside of the nucleus 

-Chromatin 

-since the dna is double stranded it cannot fit through the nuclear pores meaning you will never find DNA outside of the nucleus 

**Why do you think DNA is located inside the nucleus in a eukaryotic cell?**

**Where is the genetic instructions in each cell located?**

**What is the main function of the DNA?**

**Nucleolus**

-where the subunits of the ribosome are made

-RNA is located here

-found within the nucleus

-ribosomal rna is a nucleic acid 

**What is the function of the ribosome?**

Protein synthesis; to create proteins 

**Where could you find ribosomes in eukaryotic cells? In prokaryotic?**

Eukaryotic: on nuclear membrane and on rough ER, in cytoplasm

Prokaryotic: in the cytoplasm

-ribosomes interpret information from RNA (which received instructions from DNA) on what protein mst be made

What makes the ER smooth or rough?

-smooth is when there is no ribosomes, while rough means there are ribosomes

**Rough Ribosomes:**

-make membrane-phospholipids and embedded proteins

-make proteins secreted by the cell (secretory proteins)



1. 
Proteins that will leave the cell and go to a different destination
Endomembrane System-a group of organelles that helps package and transport materials through the cell

-transport vesicles

Etc.

**Why do we call the ER a biosynthetic workshop?**

ER produces a variety of molecules -> phospholipids for cell membranes, steroid hormones, proteins.

**Golgi Body:**

-modifies compounds from ER like glycoproteins, moves to next destination

-in only animals and plants

Lysosomes are only found in animals, while peroxisomes are only found in plants.

**Endomembrane system-**a group of organelles that helps maintain homeostasis via transporting material, packaging them, etc.

-smooth ER, nuclear membrane, Rough ER, transport vesicles, lysosomes, Golgi Apparatus, vacuole, plasma membrane are some of the endomembrane system organelles

The mitochondrion is double membrane bound (same with the nucleus)

-not seen in bacteria

-100% in plants

-in animals

-has its own DNA

-convert chemical energy of food to usable energy of the cell

-the DNA is independent from the cellâs DNA and is referred to as MTDNA, comes from only one parent

**Chloroplast**-to convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy of sugar molecule 

-has its own dna

-double membrane

-contains ribosomes

-the stack of chloroplast is a granum (grana for plural)

**Endosymbiotic Theory-**that the mitochondria was once engulfed by a bigger prokaryotic cell that ended today

-size of mitochondria 

-DNA

Topic: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Minerals</span>

Minerals-naturally occurring substances that combine to make up rocks

The Characteristics of a(n) mineral:



* Naturally occurring solids
* Inorganic (cannot be made from dead things, ex. Coal)
* Solidifies into crystals when melted
* Have a definite chemical composition

How to identify a(n) mineral:

-streak (the powdery substance left behind by the mineral after being scratched on a unglazed-porcelain tile, or any other material used as a streak plate )

-color (the mineralâs color, and is affected by certain environmental factors, which makes it an unreliable source in identifying a mineral)

-Luster(the way the surface of a mineral reflects light, non-metallic or metallic lustre)

-hardness (the mineralâs resistance to being scratched, and is measured in a scale of 1-10; the Mohs scale)

-breakage of the mineral; cleavage or fracture (Cleavage-a(n) mineralâs ability to split easily along flat plane(s)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. Fracture-when a(n) mineral breaks unevenly in irregular ways)

-crystal form (when a(n) mineral melts, it forms crystals with a specific shape as it solidifies)

-chemical composition (elements that make up the mineral)

-specific gravity (found by comparing a mineralâs density to the density of water<sup><strong>2) Ex: If the mineralâs density is 2. The specific gravity is 2 gram per cm3/1 grams per cm3 = 2. Specific gravity has no units because it is a ratio. </strong></sup>

_The rock cycle diagram that is located in the ESRT_

Rocks-are made of two or more types of minerals incorporated in them.

**The three main types of rocks:**



* Sedimentary rocks
* Metamorphic rocks
* Igneous Rocks

Sedimentary Rocks-rocks that formed from accumulated sediments.

Rocks that are formed from compaction and cementation of sediments, pebbles, or other rock/mineral particles, a very good example of this is the rock conglomerate; it is formed from other rock particles and is cemented/kept together by a type of natural cement.

The rocks that are formed in the process of compaction and cementation like conglomerate may have different age, as those sediments, pebbles, etc are formed at different times.

In a sedimentary rock, it is very common to find fossils in them, and if they are from dead things or have fossil remains are classified as **Bio**clastic, while if they are just sediments, and do not contain any types of biological substances (organic), are called clastic.

Note: Many rocks are formed with silicon-oxygen tetrahedrons.

^ESRT identification of Sedimentary rocks^

Metamorphic Rocks-rocks that formed from heat, pressure, and/or chemical action.

Rocks that are formed from intense heat and pressure, many times the rocks that experiencing this may come from igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, or metamorphic rocks.

&lt;==_A diagram of a **Contact Metamorphism**_

**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Regional</span>_**-when heat and pressure softens and recrystallizes existing rocks through the movement of continental plates or rough movements of the crust.

Foliation is the banding and layering of the metamorphic rock

Types of foliation in metamorphic rocks:

**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Banded Foliation</span>_**-a types of banding/layering of different minerals 

**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Slaty Foliation</span>_**-a type of foliation in which are commonly found in slate

**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Gneissic Foliation</span>_**-a type of foliation found commonly in the rock gneiss

**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Schistose Foliation</span>_**-a type of foliation found commonly in the rock Schist

-Remember that a metamorphic rock rarely contains a fossil. 

-Metamorphic Rocks can also form from other metamorphic rocks

Recrystallization-when a mineral doesnât fully melt, but solidifies in that form.

^ESRT identification of Metamorphic Rocks^

Igneous Rocks-Rocks that formed from hot molten rocks lying deep within the earthâs crust

Rocks that form from hot, molten rock lying deep within the earthâs crust, and then rises to the earthâs surface and cools/solidifies. 

Depending on the cooling speed of the rock, crystals will form or no crystals will form.

_If the rock cools at a fast speed, no crystals will appear (ex. Obsidian), while rocks that cools slowly will form bigger crystals. The cooling speed also affects the distortion of the rock (mafic or felsic), a mafic rock will be higher in density, have a darker colour tone, on the other hand a felsic rock will have, paler colour tone, and lower density._

_Process of forming an igneous rock: _



* _solidification of magma (magma is the melting of metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks, and igneous Rocks)_
* _Melting_-when molten rocks of sedimentary, metamorphic, or igneous Rocks are experienced to high temperatures and pressure, turning them to magma

#### Topic <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The dynamic crust</span>

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Earthquakes</span>** -any shaking or rapid movement of earthâs solid outer layers

**Earthquakes form when stress builds along a fault, and then when the stress on the crust is much more intensity than the amount it can resist, which results in the crust to shift and break.**

**There can be earthquakes that can be created by man made objects (ex. Subways.etc)**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The earthâs crust is always shifting and moving due to:</span>**



1. **Horizontal sedimentary rock layers (strata) are seen and appears at high elevations**

**              -This occurs due to uplift**



2. **Fossils/animal remains are appearing in sedimentary rocks at the high elevations**
3. **There are bent and folded parts of sedimentary rocks; they are bent, tilted, and/or folded.**
4. Faults
5. Volcanoes may change the features of the earth
6. Changes in elevations and vertical crustal movements
7. Earthquakes will reoccur in the same areas or regions

**Potential Energy-a point when energy is being build-up**

-When energy is being built, it is called elastic-potential energy

-chemical-potential energy is involved when energy is gained from consumption or energy gained from chemicals

**Kinetic Energy-when the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">potential energy</span> is being released **

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Types of Seismic Waves</span>

P-waves-AKA **Primary waves**; a wave that travels faster than S-waves; they are in the section of compressional waves, can go through liquids & solids **_Remember: the denser the object, the faster the p-waves will travel_**

-You can squish stuff with P-Waves

-P-Waves are compressional

S-waves-AKA-Shear or Secondary waves; in the section of transverse waves, can only pass through solids, and also travels slower than P-waves

-The âsâ in S-Waves can also be for slower

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Vocabulary:</span>**

**Faults-**a zone of weakness or a crack where previous plate movements have occurred

**Seismic Waves**-The energy that radiates from an earthquake that is expressed in vibration form 

Focus-AKA hypocenter; the place underground where the first break occurs

Epicentre-The location at Earthâs surface just above the focus<sub>(See definition for âfocusâ)</sub>

Intensity-the magnitude of the earthquake .

Seismograph-an instrument that records ground vibration (usually one that is from an earthquake)

Tsunami-an earthquake under the ocean and creates a big wave that will create a catastrophic damage to land.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pangaea</span>**-A Supercontinent

Inference that many years ago all earthâs land masses were âall stuck together.â

Alfred Wegener-The one who noticed that land masses that they could fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. He also proposed a theory âContinental Driftâ

This states that the continents move across the earthâs surfaces

Convection currents are the forces that help pull continents and landmasses together.

Alfredâs theory got approved when they found out through the dinosaur fossils that were in Africa (Fossil Evidence), and they also found the same relating types of fossils around the globe.

They also compared the structures of the coastlines of the continents (rock formations)

-Since <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pangaea</span> is a supercontinent, that means all original (this means excluding Hawaii, and other small islands smaller than 10,000 kilometres in span) continents were formed and were once part of this supercontinent.

#### Topic _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Weathering & Erosion</span>_

**Weathering-**The chipping/breaking down of rocks and minerals(there are two kinds of weathering: Physical and Chemical)

_Chemical Weathering_

**Erosion-**the transportation of weathered rocks, this is done by the agents of erosion, like moving water, the wind, etc.

**Deposition-**When weathered rocks that have been carried/transported by an agent of erosion.

Chemical Weathering is a chemical reaction with rocks that takes place to break that rock down. This happens mostly with limestone and acid rain, due to the composition of limestone(calcite).
